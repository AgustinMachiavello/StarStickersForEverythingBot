# StarStickersForEverythingBot
## Description
This python script gets the latest comments from the subreddit r/toastme and generates a phrase with the same kind of writting or style of the comments using **Markov chains**.  Then it crops the text into an star template image and posts it to Facebook :) 
**There is nothing too complitaced in this script, so any modifications should be easy to apply (owo)**
## Disclaimer
Unfortunately, due to new Facebook politics, post can't be auto-uploaded anymore (yikes). **The rest of script still works!**
