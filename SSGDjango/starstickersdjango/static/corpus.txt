Is that the Bi flag in the background? Also, you have really pretty eyes. And don't take the other people's insults too seriously
Yo man! Life gets better my man. Everyone has their ups and downs, and yeah it sucks that you are down on your bday, but there is always tomorrow. You grab onto tomorrow and have a great day. Go do something simple but gives you a set of accomplishment. Hold onto even the smallest glint of good, don’t slip back into the darkness where you find yourself all alone.
Ona different note... yo man, that blue hair is cool as hell.
Here's an internet hug. I'm sorry this happened. Also, I'm digging the blue hair
Hey, man. 

Maybe you missed the memo, but being socially awkward is where it's at these days. You're just ahead of the curve. 

Never let anyone make you feel underappreciated and unvalued, because I think you're pretty wonderful, and I hope you each day is better than the last.
I prefer this side of the spectrum. Also, who isn't awkward? I think awkwardness is what makes us us.
Yaaaaay self care 🌻 

Hope you do great in university and reach inner peace.
Great work so happy for you that you are choosing to make your mental health a priority 😊
Admitting that you have mental health issues and seeking help is one of the biggest hurdles and the fact you did so is a testament to your recovery.  You're a wonderful lady and you're going to have a great time in college.  I bet the people you meet will be absolutely enthralled with you, and they're so lucky to have the privilege of your company
Glad to hear that you’re getting your mind into shape  - all of the mental exercise will pay off. You’ve earned it - so happy for you!
Oh, wow!

You're gonna whip college, no problem, I'm sure of it! Keep that warm smile shining bright, friend!
Way to go. Remember to celebrate even the smallest victories
You have such a cute, infectious smile. It makes everyone who looks at you want to smile. Also, I'm proud of you. Good luck at college.
Thank you!! Inner peace is exactly what I'm aiming for ♡
Thank you ♡ I struggled to accept that I should go back to therapy, but I'm hopeful this was the correct choice ♡
That is so sweet, thank you so much!! I really appreciate your kind words ♡♡
My mind will be super buff once I'm recovered!! Thank you ♡♡
Thank you ♡♡ Will make sure my smile keeps going strong!! ♡
thank you, will do ♡♡
thank you so much..! I'm actually kinda self-conscious about my smile, so this means a lot ♡♡
It's really cute.
That fish you drew is awesome and you’re beautiful. This post also exudes an amazing positivity that makes me really confident you’ll be a successful person no matter what life throws at you.
Not sure what it was but either way just know there are positive thoughts flowing into the universe for you! And if by chance its type 1 diabetes I esp feel for you, my 4 yr old son got diagnosed last year, it's been hard but we are attacking it together everyday! 
  You will get thru and if you ever need more encouragement or to vent just message me! No one has to be alone!
You have such a kind smile and warm eyes. I have no doubt that you will face this hardship and sail right through, because you're strong. So, so strong.
You have such a warm smile - I hope you find the strength you need to make this transition in your life. I know change is intimidating, but you’ve got this.
I'm sorry. I hope it gets easier. I'll support you. Also, I love your look.
Your beard is beyond epic! Keep on fighting the good fight.
That is a great motto to life. I'm happy that you're happy. Also, that beard is epic.
You know it! Head down and keep grinding and it’s finally starting to pay off.
I know self harm can be a hard drug to resist. I offer that I'm always a message away if you feel alone. As a bipolar person I feel your pain and know that the struggle seems daunting but you are strong it's in there. Plus can I say your lovely and rocking those glasses.
Hey sweetie, sorry you're feeling down. Please, please, please don't self harm. It makes me sad to think that you're in so much pain that you have to hurt yourself. 

I want you to know that I love you unconditionally, I think you're special, and you make this world a beautiful place just by being yourself.

I also love your artwork. It really speaks to me.

Sending love, hope, encouragement, and positve thoughts.

Peace.
Wow you sound very similar to what I wrote. All I can say from a fellow bi polar friend is that we just have to take it one day at a time.  You can't change yesterday and have no control over tomorrow. So please enjoy your day!! I am thinking of you. What has happened doesn't control our destiny.
I always find it hard to think of something to say... but I want you to know you are so very worth it, you deserve to be happy and to be loved. I really hope you feel better soon and I just know everything will turn out good for you. You are a beautiful person inside and out and deserve to be happy <3 <3
Just a few reasons why you are awesome: 

1. You are beautiful 

2. The way you held the paper with your glasses shows you are adorably creative

3. You bared your soul for strangers on the internet and reached out for help when you needed it. That shows incredible bravery

4. You are strong. Despite the struggles you've had you are still here fighting 

You deserve love and happiness. The world is a better place with you in it. I wish you a bright, beautiful future where these dark days are the dimmest of memories <3
I got tired of trying to figure out how to hold the paper and not be self conscious of my hands so I just stuck it in my glasses.
You deserve to feel happy and safe and secure, and I’m sorry that you don’t feel that way right now. You don’t deserve the hurt you give yourself, even if you feel like you do. If you want a tree in your garden, the best day to plant it was 20 years ago. The second best day is today. Make today the start of your new streak of days without sh - pick that momentum back up again and break your old record
Genius. 

See? You're a problem solver. I've been in a similar situation, and I know it is tough. And it is going to be tough. But, as we just established, you're a problem solver. 

You're smart and creative in your thought process, so I know you will be able to over come this. Take it a simple day at a time, and before you know it, days stretch into weeks and years. 

You are not alone. You got this.
My grandfather also had Alzheimers. A wise men once told me that it's the quality of time that's important, not the quantity. No matter what, your father still loves you. He will always love you. You are his son. Nothing will ever change that. 

Also, I'm wishing your sister a quick recovery.
I didn’t figure out what I wanted to do with my life until I was almost done with my second degree. Don’t put too much pressure on yourself! Take a variety of classes, it might help you find what you want to do. Whatever it ends up being, enjoy learning new things until you figure it out.

Also, Alzheimer’s sucks, but it doesn’t change how much your dad loves you. He may not remember your name, but there will always be something inside him that knows he loves you.
life is hard but it will make you a better man just stay strong brother !
Life can be a dick sometimes, we know. You just gotta swim through the bullshit, and climb to the top. Conquer life. You can do it bro, we believe in you.
My grandfather sent me a copy of this poem when I was in my early 20's with a short note explaining how it was his favorite poem and helped him, he hoped it would do me the same. I hope this poem helps you the way it continues to help me:   


The Road Not Taken  
By Robert Frost   


Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,   
And sorry I could not travel both  
And be one traveler, long I stood  
And looked down one as far as I could  
To where it bent in the undergrowth;  


Then took the other, as just as fair,   
And having perhaps the better claim,   
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;  
Though as for that the passing there  
Had worn them really about the same,   


And both that morning equally lay  
In leaves no step had trodden black.  
Oh, I kept the first for another day!   
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,   
I doubted if I should ever come back.   


I shall be telling this with a sigh  
Somewhere ages and ages hence:   
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I--   
I took the one less traveled by,   
And that has made all the difference.
Dating is so hard! But keep trying, don’t let this get you down. You are a good looking dude and only 23!
I'm sorry for what your going through, I can only imagine the deception you must be feeling from that message. 

You seem like a great guy in appearance, i'm quite surprise things are not more favorable in the dating area. I hope you meet someone that completes you soon. Take care!
Ugh! Dating apps are the worst; they’re especially hard when you’re young and trying for dates. You deserve to invest in yourself and your interests, love with come naturally when it’s ready. Your hair is gorgeous and your eyebrows are great! Keep being you and the right person will come along.
Haven't had much experience with dating sites but it can be rough. I admire your persistence. You can have all my online hugs. Your smile is really cute and I love your hair btw!
If I was there, I'd give you a hug. Someone someday is going to come around. You don't know yet, but someone is going to think you are the most amazing guy in the world. Just hang in there.
You look like the kind of guy that would take a girl out to watch a sunrise/sunset-a good thing
Aw you’re pretty handsome!
{{{{¥}}}}
You’re handsome and young, you will find your person. Don’t get discouraged!! You have kind eyes and from what I can tell a good soul. (((Hugs)))
Thanks. I don't blame her, she was dealing with a lot of inner turmoil and conflict after meeting the other guy this weekend, since they have certain things in common.
Gurl, what's wrong with either? Mainly the thighs touching, which is completely normal depending on body type!

You can wear whatever you feel comfortable wearing, and you don't even look a day over 30 like please.
You look fucking amazing. Wear whatever you want!
Hi! Local body positive activist here - your body is just fine and awesome the way it is! You deserve to take up space, wear whatever you want, and not be ashamed. Stretch marks are natural and most human beings - thin, mid size, plus size, everyone - have them. Your body is strong and capable of taking you where you want to go, and that’s amazing. You are worthy of respect, love, and being seen no matter your shape or size. You’re crushing it! I’m sure your friends don’t give a single thought to the way your body looks; they just want to have fun and spend time with you.
I think you look great 👍
Yes ma'am you are of course allowed! And you look damn fine in it, I must say. I hope next time you can focus on having fun! You truly look beautiful!
Remember, the world is filled with people and most of them struggle with some sort of perceived imperfection, myself included. You are human and imperfect and lovely 💖
I have those things, too. You look great. Love the suit. Great makeup.
Wear whatever you want with pride! 
Like wow! You are gorgeous at 40!
Rock it, girl!
You aren’t going to getting anyone looking at you in disgust for wearing that out swimming for sure. You are in shape enough to wear that.  I wouldn’t feel self conscious, especially at 40.
You're gorgeous!
Judging by the picture, I thought you were 28. You look really good. You can really rock that bikini. Also, I like the pink hair.
screw the petite friends i would want you!!!! That right there is a real woman!!! wear whatever you want you look incredible in the bikini!!!!
Well my bf likes to tell me ‘thick thighs save lives’ and honestly, unless you told me, I would have never thought you were 40. Literally you look maaaaaybe 30. Also you are absolutely allowed to wear a bikini!! Try on any bathing suit that makes you happy! I’ve had stretch marks all over my body since I was 10 (grew really fast) So trust me when I say this; your lightning stripes are beautiful. It’s like having tattoo’s that your body made for itself. Yeah they aren’t the greatest and you may even regret them but there’s no denying that they’re still art ❤️.
Don’t look 40 to me! I’m 42, and ya know, just like wine, we all get better with age. You got looks, wisdom, and experience...imma bet there were some dudes straight checking you out, you just didn’t know it.
Your eyes are gorgeous. Just a pic of your face alone would display your natural beauty. Stay positive!
You look like you’re 25! 
You’re very pretty :)
You look great from head to toe =)
Totally ogle you at the beach and totally tap that 🤷🏻‍♂️
You look good!

I do empathize with you and actually commend you for going to the beach with your friends! I'm a dude and even though there's less pressure for us with appearances, I still have a hard time enjoying time at the beach if it's going to be surrounded with people who have great bodies.

Like I have no problem going there by myself or with family or whatever, but if I'm the only one with an "unhealthy" body type, I have a hard time.

So not only do you look good, but you have confidence as well! That's great! Keep it up!
You probably wouldn’t get this reference but Kakyoin approves
You look like Tara Reid (back in the day before she destroyed herself with booze and whatnot), especially in the eyes. Which are beautiful btw.
First of all, you look great. Second, wear whatever the hell you want. I’m 51 and you bet your ass I wear whatever, including a bikini if I feel like it. Anyone who says you can’t has issues.
What others think doesn't matter. Unless them bitches paying your bills, you pay those bitches no mind ;) You look fabulous sug!
Honey, if I had your body I would be so proud! I see nothing wrong here. You are beautiful!!
Girl im 42 and i wish my body looked like yours. You r  rocking it. Btw im jealous of your cleavage
You look amazing, and that bikini is SO cute!!! I especially love the pattern on the top!

I'm a 26yo mom with stretch marks and a LOT of pale skin. I feel you.

But here's something I try to tell myself often that the only person who's opinion truly matters is yourself.

You're beautiful!
I think you look awesome!
You're gorgeous!
Beautiful skin and body. It's so easy for us to be hard on ourselves. I think you look great
:( makes me sad to see someone gorgeous feeling insecure. Plenty of bikini years left in you girl x
 HI There! Sorry I"m a little late in finding this post. Would you still like 1 from me? Thanks! :)  My gosh, you look great! I dunno what those people are talking about. Dang!
Wear that bikini with pride.
You look fantastic
I agree, she looks much younger than 40!!
Thank you! ❤
Thigh gaps are overrated and stretch marks don’t matter. I think you look great.
Thanks! Needed to hear that today ❤
Thank you! I guess you're right about my friends. It's just that I always felt BIG compared to them. Thanks for your words, they ment a great real today! ❤
Thank you! 😊
Thank you! And I know, you're right, one shouldn't compare body types or anything for that matter. Thanks for the reminder! ❤
Thank you! In that case, you have great thighs too! ;) ❤
Thanks! Today I really needed to hear that! ❤
Thank you! I think I will! 😊
Thank you! ❤
Thanks! You have no idea how good it feels to hear that after today! ❤
Thank you! 😊 28... hah! I have a 17 year old son :-P But your comment made me happy! Thanks! ❤
Thanks! 😊 I feel like an amazon next to my petite friends. I'm 5'8" and, well,  big built :-P
Thanks for your kind words! ❤ perhaps I should wear my stretch marks with more pride. They are a sign I carried two babies after all. 😊
Thank you! 😊❤
Mostly I feel it too 😊
There’s nothing wrong with being big or small or tall or short compared to anyone else! I totally understand the comparison and feeling inadequate in a society that says “thin=beautiful=worthy.” Their bodies are great and so is yours :)  Your body is yours alone, and it’s the only one you get. You deserve to love it and show it off however you’re comfortable. You don’t have to be small to be beautiful, worthy, seen, etc. I hope the rest of your day and week are fantastic!
You’re most welcome ❤️ Enjoy the summer!
perfect high and perfect build. You my dear look incredible!!! rock the bikini
Two kids, 40 years old, and you still look that good in a bikini?! Honey I pray I look like you one day. You’re aging like wine.
And yours too!! Thanks again! 😭❤
Thanks! 😘
Hey, the whole sub is about attention and validation! It's okay to need support and love in your life; we're all here to help give it to you :) You don't deserve to be yelled at or berated. You're allowed to be whoever you are and to do what's best for yourself. Some day you will get out of this situation and be surrounded by nothing but those who support you and hope the best for you.

Even in tears, your eyeliner is super sharp and your eyebrows are on point. That's a skill! Your haircut frames your face very well and it's a super cute color!

And if it'll help, the community over at r/raisedbynarcissists is awesome for people with overbearing and difficult parents; we're always happy to listen and support on that sub, too.
I think we all like attention. Some people just don't admit it lol. Sorry your mom yells at you a lot. That sucks, but hopefully you don't have to live with her much longer. You're super cute! :) i like your bangs!
Oh sweetie, I'm so sorry you have to suffer like this. You don't deserve to be treated this way.

No matter what I love you unconditionally, you are beautiful, and you make this world a better place just by being yourself, no matter what your mom might think.

Sending love, encouragement, hope, and positive thoughts.

Peace.

Also, I saw on your profile you like classical. Here's an animation set to La Damnation de Faust https://youtu.be/SL6-gTwuV8s
I'm not sure how old you are but I was raised by a pretty horrible mom that gaslighted me and treated me like shit my entire life. She told me I'd never be able to do anything and I got a kick-ass degree and will "hopefully" have a kick-ass job soon. You can and will get away soon, and your life will become your own. You'll be able to look back on this and the pain will only be a very faint memory. It hurts now, and it's horrible you're experiencing it, but you will come out the other side. I spent time at friend's houses a lot, and as soon as I was 18 I was fucking out the door faster than you could imagine. Even when she threatened to kill herself if I left, I still walked out - and she's still alive. Don't let your mother's bitterness take you down with her. They know the right buttons to push and its painful and shitty and horrible, but I promise you, you will be able to take control one day. And when you do, you'll be unstoppable.
We need to take away the stigma of the phrase "attention seeker" many people do it for the wrong reasons, but then there's the one like you who just want a smiling face to make sure they're alright. Well know that I see you and I acknowledge your pain and rest assured I'm sending as much positivity and love as I can muster to help you shine bright like the star you are 😁❤️
I am a mom. Feel free to use my words as mom instead of hers.

I'm proud of you. It takes a lot of courage to speak up and speak out about your mental health. It takes a lot of strength to survive in a household where you constantly feel cut down. You are worth love and kindness. Keep fighting for yourself. Stay strong. Make me proud by being there best version of yourself that you can be. It's ok to have bad days, just do your best to stand back up and move forward when they're over.
I really want to give you a hug right now. I hope you can be somewhere where you are appreciated. I hope you can be happy. If you need anything, I'll be here. 

Also, I really like your hair. It's cute.
You look like you could be a rockstar that eventually leaves the industry due to corrupt agents/managers and becomes an independent artist that loses popularity yet maintains a loyal fan base because the music is just so good.
I wish I could wing my eye liner that well! You’re beautiful. I hope everyone’s encouragement helps.
Hey there. Chin up! You’ve got a lot going for yourself. You’re young, beautiful and smart.
I'm sorry about the way you're treated by your mom. Always remember you deserve better than that and will live a full and happy life. You are stronger than you know.
Hugs. Sometimes we are at are darkest before arr best moments. Yours will come just have to wait but it will be worth it.
Oh snap I love your eye makeup!!
It takes strength to even repost I’m sure although through negativity your heart is growing stronger so when it comes to love you will be able to love much stronger than any metal there is
Honestly my mother yelled "What's wrong with you?" at me so many times when I was younger. It was difficult, but I eventually moved past consistently thinking something is wrong with me. I know it's rough, but it gets better. Stay strong.
Needing some positive feedback doesn’t make you an attention seeker, it just means you know you deserve better than you’re getting. Hold on to that knowledge, and when you find someone who treats you the way you deserve, you’ll feel it. Just make sure that you treat yourself right, too!
Your hair is perfectly matched to your features, which are absolutely stunning!

I'm sorry you're caught up in an unpleasant home life... You look strong. You are the super hero in your own life. I believe you can make it through this!
The way a person treats you is a reflection of THEM, not you! 

You deserve love and happiness and your mother being a bitch is not your fault. Hang in there! Sending you virtual hugs if you want them!
Of course you seek (positive) attention. You need it like medicine. I don't know what your mothers problem is, but she seems toxic. I'm glad you reach out to us for help. You give us a chance to help you and that is a valuable gift to give us.

Looking at your profile shows me that you are a bright young woman but it looks like you have some rough years ahead of you. Take all the help you can get and you will muster through.

As children we are very loyal to our parents but you are old enough to see that your loyalty ~~should~~ must be to yourself first. Don't be afraid to consider talking to the CPS about what's going on.
I don't think cry face suits you, I know it's a cliche but too pretty for cry face. All I can say is once youre past it, you'll realise how short it was. I hope something great comes along and provides indestructible smile face.

10/10 would save if in distress.
That winged liner tho!! 😍😍😍
Thank you. This made me cry more, but they were more happy tears than sad :)
I have to live with my parents for two more years, and then I start college. Thank you :)
I have no idea what that piece is or what it’s about, but it did help me calm down and stop crying, so thank you :)
I’d have to have a good voice for that. I used to think I had an okay voice, but my mom says I really don’t so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
My mom used to yell at me about how much of a disappointment, now she just says how shitty I am and how sick of my attitude she is.
Hey, crying is good! Let yourself feel whatever you're feeling. I hope the rest of your day is a little lighter :)
Best of luck to you 💖
To be honest, she can shove it, in my opinion. You're not obligated to impress your mother or have the sort of attitude she likes.
can i just say, your toasting lifted *my* mood. you really are a snack that smiles back 😁
You're really pretty. Your eyes are just absolutely beautiful. 

Also, congrats on the degree. I'm sorry about the interview. I hope you find your dream job soon. Something that meets and exceeds your expectations.
Job hunting sucks ass and is super draining, but you worked damn hard for that degree. Someone will definitely recognize that and offer you a great job.
"you can walk straight through hell with a smile" - you got this!!!
Don't count yourself out! You got a whole entire degree and deserve to be proud of yourself. The job hunt is hard, but you can do hard things. You're smart and capable. There will be more applications and more interviews and more opportunities. Doors will open for you soon. Be kind to yourself while you wait for them to.

And on a lighter note, you have such striking eyes, gorgeous hair, and a lovely bone structure. Your skin is beautiful & I will buy whatever your routine is tbh.
Don't let yourself get down over a single interview...hell, even over a couple dozen interviews. Just be persistent and stay positive. I guarantee you'll find a nice job.  
Edit: Thought of something else I wanted to say. First off, they stood you up on an interview?? To hell with that company, that's a huge red flag. Second, it wasn't a complete waste for you either; you spent time preparing, and that's time well spent.
Thank you! <3 I know I'll get there soon. I'm just very drained from the process.
Pffffft. I'm super flattered that you actually think I have a routine. xD If I could bottle "roll out of bed like idgaf" I wouldn't need a job!
Girl I would buy it!
Lovely smile, beautiful eyes. Their loss. Save your heart for someone who will treasure it.
Keep on smiling, it suits you 😊
You'll find somebody someday! You're worth it!
You look like a wonderful, sweet, kind, beautiful person so whoever broke your heart doesn't deserve someone like you and you deserve all you want in life and more
 Even your forced smile is beautiful; I hope the world will get to see the real thing from you soon. 

That really sucks, but the right person for you is going to come along when it’s time; since this clearly wasn’t it, that means someone even better is coming, which also means you just dodged a bullet without even realizing it. Take heart, friend—this is the lead-up to things getting much better for you, and I can’t wait to see what is in store for you.
You have a super cute button nose. Heart break is a horrible thing. It hurts less over time.
You're adorable!
Heartbreak is hard to beat, but it helps you grow and be strong. You'll find the right person in time. Be your best self each day, and good times will come your way. Stay positive ♥️
So sorry this happened to you, but it’ll turn out to be for the best! You’re objectively gorgeous and I’m sure you’ll be back on your feet soon!
You should smile more cuz you have a very cute one
You’re a cutie! And a broken heart is awful, but I just feel you will find someone else that’s even better, and loves you back a 100%.

I know, seems far away now, but I still wanted to say it.

Keep on smiling as you look great doing so, and you will surely mend that heart :)
You have a cute smile and a super cute nose! I hope you start to heal and find someone who loves you for you unconditionally:) have a good week :)
You are cute as a button: nice eyes, good symmetrical features, nice smile. Very pretty, whoever broke your heart was a chump.
Well you are gorgeous plenty of opportunities when you are ready 👍
You are beautiful and even your forced smile looks lovely so your real smile must look even lovelier! 

I had my heart broken badly last year, and it was horrible. I know that everyone will tell you that you’ll feel better with time, and that it’s probably the last thing you want to hear, but it’s true. In the early days I found that distracting myself helped the most - I watched a lot of Netflix in bed cuddling teddies. 

When you feel up to it, spending time with friends and family really helps take your mind off it - making new, happy memories with people who love you helps your heart to remember that life is still beautiful, vibrant and so full of love, even if it doesn’t always seem it. 

Sorry if any of that sounds patronising/really obvious - I think it’s what I would have wanted somebody to say to me this time last year when I had my heart broken so I hope it helps you, even just a little bit. I have every faith that you will get through this and come out happier and stronger on the other side!
If he/she broke your heart, they aren't the one for you. You're beautiful and I know your smile will get easier as time passes.
Heartbreak happens to the best of us, but now you have the opportunity to truly invest in and fall in love with yourself. You deserve it! Best of luck as you go through this
You have a cute smile
You have a beautiful smile and I think it would be even more pretty if it was truly genuine. I hope in the future you’ll bless the world with it. :))
Someone's going to think you're absolutely adorable, with beautiful eyes and a pretty smile, and an amazing personality. Actually, I think that, and I think most of the world thinks that. You're going to find someone. I know it. And in the meantime, know that you are a strong, independent person who only wants the best for herself. Because she only deserves the best.
You adore Adore Delano?? Such good taste in drag queens! (Adore is so iconic)
Heartbreak sucks, but with a smile like that, someone is sure to come along and put it back together. Keep smiling!
But when you do smile...it’s beautiful...do more of that.
I would kill for your perfect little nose!!
Ehhh I was a big fan when I made that account, but she’s been kind of a brat lately, so I’m sticking with my eternal fav Phi Phi, and the new Dragula cast as my faves
Honestly my nose has always been my biggest insecurity so everyone complimenting it is just hitting the right spot😭😭
No way, I'm super jealous! I've built up a "nose job" fund several times to get a look similar to yours lol. But I think we all want what we don't have, right?
I’ve just always thought it’s too big for my face
That sounds really tough and frustrating. But jobs change and so do dreams and new opportunities always arise, so all is not lost. And you have pretty eyes and great coloring and a fantastic sense of style!
You'll get there someday! Also I love your hair.
All I can say is Hang in there, friend. You can make it through this.
Your enthusiasm for that which you enjoy is truly a marvel. I cannot understate how palpable your passion for things is; I think that's super fucking cool.

Oh also, I really dig your style. :)
You will beat this. Your life will improve. You dont know me but remember me because one day you'll realize I was right. You can change, you can grow, you can thrive.
I lost my shot at a dream job too just the other day, it hurts. It's even worse when you're not all that happy at your current job. Definitely don't feel bad that you gave up the better paying one. You know what you need, so feel confident in that and don't let yourself regret it for a second. This setback is only temporary. Even if you don't ever get that dream job, a new dream may one day inspire you, indeed it probably will, life it just kinda like that. You can fulfill this dream too though if you keep at it, and the wait will only make it more meaningful, not less.

In other news, those glasses really suit you, as does that hair color and style with the way it frames your face. You've a good fashion sense, you look pretty classy, especially the necklace.
Your style is iconic! You'll find a career path that suits you with time and patience. For now, you're totally allowed to be upset and stressed over it -- do what you can to add some more self care and stress relief in the mean time :)
You remind me of Lydia from Beetlejuice! Always a good thing!
Hey, I find it super admirable that you'd stay true to yourself, turning down that supposedly desirable position when it didn't really resonate with your passions! I believe it takes some balls to do something like that and I applaud you for it.

That being said, I'm really sorry you didn't get your dream job. You surely would have deserved it but it just didn't happen yet, not this time. However, I'm positive there will definitely come more opportunities for you to express and apply yourself on that path you desire to travel, 100%!You don't sound like the kind of person to me who would give in and stop trying, even if you are feeling stressed and discouraged now. It's okay to feel down, but remember how far you have already gotten, and how close you already were - take that as a positive. And then when you are ready to give another go, do it, as bravely as you did now. Take this as an opportunity to learn, and remember that everyone gets turned down sometimes, even the greatest of the greatest. You've got this!

Also, I love your style. I find it quite fascinating! The necklace is amazing.
Aw, I'm really sorry. It can't be easy, I can relate as I'm in a rough job myself and could use something better. I sincerely think this will pass for you, and judging by your clothes and appearance, you'll still have a great sense of style after it does too. Good luck out there and be good to yourself. <3
It's always good to count the things that you are happy with in your life. I count my self very unlucky with relationships but when I go into work everybody is kind to me. When I read what you posted I realized that everyone has ups and downs in their lives.
Fair play if you ambitious a few kmockbacls are to be expected, and fair play waiting for something right for you. It may not be the easier path but it's  the most courageous.
Thank you so so much!!
I'm feeling so down declining a job that could make my financial burdens lessen...but I guess I think of it as *if I'm going to be looking for better, I should be doing such while I'm happy and comfortable, which I am in my current position*


Thank you for your words. 💕💕
Thank you so much!!!

I'm praying someday soon haha
Iconic? 🥰💕 oh my heavens thank you so so much!!

I'm hoping and praying!!
Best compliment ever!!!🥰🥰🥰🥰
I'm tearing up at work now for a totally different reason!!😭🥰🥰🥰
Your words are so kind and wonderful I could embroider them on my pillow!

I'm going to keep trying!!
Haha thanks! I've been called many things , but courageous has never been one of them.
I'm hoping my future is as bright as I wish it to be!
Not having enough money is always stressful. But if you can get by as you are for a while then you’re in a strong position. Hang in there! 💪♥️
You're welcome!
Yes your matte black glasses are so cute and that choker is awesome! Clearly you have passion and a vibrant sense of self; you'll be just fine :)
Exactly. I'm working a full regular salary job and then a small part time job after work 3 times a week. It's a little extra, but I'm thankful
As long as you have space and time to be your excellent self, all is well.
You should be very proud of yourself for being such a strong, ambitious person.  A job isn't worth destroying your mental health over, irregardless of the compensation.  Even though you were passed over for your dream job, I believe in you and I know with determination you'll get there eventually.
Your hair looks magically soft.
Your 5 o’clock shadow is doing a lot for you! Really brings out your handsomeness.
OP you look cute!
Btw sorry for the bad pic my phone isn’t that good so the writing isn’t that clear
You can only do so much and there will be someone who would appreciate what you’ve done more than she did. Dont ever change keep being that great dude to everyone
You're doing the right thing, man. Nobody you should be with should lead you on according to their whims. While it's understandable that you feel guilty, remember that her problems aren't your doing, and aren't your obligation. You tried to help her and she treated you with disrespect. Time to move on. Stay strong, stay positive, and know that you made the right decision. We're here for ya. ✊
Hey there! You are a good looking person and I'm sure you'll have no problems finding other amazing women (when you're ready to look again). And when you do feel up to it again, just remember that you can't be anyone else's salvation just like no one else can be that for you. Take care of yourself!
You look like the kind of guy that butterflies would trust and sit on your hand
You seem, like a great guy. You'll surely find someone better soon.
A very handsome man. You should not feel bad, I’m sure many other girls/guys/whatever like you. This one girl shouldn’t slow you down, keep on pedaling!
I’m so sorry this happened ): I know you’ll find someone who will treat you right and love you unconditionally! Keep your chin up! You’re a handsome guy and you’ll find someone that fits you even better! I hope you have a great day 😊
I’ve gone through the same scenario my friend. If there is someone like that that you chase for so long and they only end up wanting you when you aren’t around, it’s toxic. You deserve much better and you will find better. Hang in there my guy
It's easy to blame yourself in situations like this, but truth be told, she probably wasn't open to help. Hopefully now this is a wake up call for her to get the help she needs. I'm sure you did all that you could, and you're looking good today too!
Focus on yourself man, you're gonna be okay cuz if you had the time to chase that kind of girl, you surely will find the time to focus on yourself and be open to more positive changes.
I'm sorry about that. I'm supporting you. I know you can definitely find someone else if you want to. If not, you are a handsome, likeable guy that deserves to be happy.
You deserve better than to let her make her issues your problem. A true soulmate will reciprocate and will put in as much effort as you. You obviously are a very loving and caring person, and your soulmate will see that, too.
Hey homeboy! Stay strong and don’t get sucked into negativity. Don’t beat yourself up about the girl, focus on moving forward and progressing in life
You are adorable with great hair. You will find a girl who is everything she was and more who appreciates you for you and not just how you feed her ego. Also you are young and you can do anything!!
What’s that?
Light beard stubble
Ahh gotcha thanks!
First day jitters are normal! You've got this. You made it this far, nowhere to go but up!
Easy, just don't overthink things. Be calm.
Congratulations!
It'll take some time to adjust to the new gig and find your stride but the good news is that your new employer knows that too. Just hit the ground running and everything will be fine.

I wish you the best of luck and hope that this turns out to be the start of a great thing for you.
Knock it out of the park!
You have lovely kind eyes, any new job is lucky to have you. I noticed your paw print tattoo - I have one too! All the paws that walked through your life will keep you safe on your first day.
First day scares are normal. Think positive and you’ll fucken nail it! (Self pep talk- scream it!)
You got this 💪🏻 you applied because you know your qualified so now go show them your over qualified by doing the best you can!
You look powerfull and incontrol! Dont be scared look what you can do and do it. Give it your best and you will be welcome on the long run. Dont be discouraged by smal knockbacks and most importandly have fun!
Congratulations!!
So what's the new job....

Visualise what you have to do and see yourself achieving it.... Good luck
Hey. If you can handle tattoos, especially big ones, you can handle anything. 😃 Stay cool, stay confident, and kick ass!
You got this! They hired you because they believe in you. You'll do great!
You're going to do amazing on this first day of your job. I know it's not ideal to feel nervous on your first day, but it's understandable. It's like being nervous for a first day of school, etc. It's similar, anyway. I'm not sure how intense it is for you, but I think you're going to do great. I hope that you enjoy your new job, too.

I'm happy to hear you have a new job, too. Sometimes it's what we need. I'm hoping it will be a positive thing for you. I had an interview for a new job myself yesterday. So I understand the nervousness of it. I think change can sometimes be a good thing. I hope it will be for you.

Cheers to you for going forward and being brave and going to your new job. :)
Congrats on the new gig! You will do great things. Have an amazing day!!
Things are never as bad as you think they are/will be. You got this!
First off, you are going to do great! Don't be afraid to ask questions, but I'm sure that you will rock this job. 

Secondly, you are gorgeous, and I thought you should know
You got this.  You’re gonna be great.  I started a new job in September of 18.  Even with 15 years of experience in my field - I still had jitters, my first day.   It ended up being the best professional decision I’ve ever made. Good luck to you.  Your gonna kill it.
It's always nerve wracking to start a new job, but you got the job! That's half the battle. You are the person they want and you'll do great! Your hair is super cute too. ❤️❤️ I hope you have a good day!
Oh wow, you look awesome. Neat tattoos from what I can tell, and those buns for your hair are adorable as hell, you also have lovely eyes!

&#x200B;

Good luck in your new job, I know you'll rock it.
Everyone's nervous on the first day, you'll be alright.

Also, not relevant but your hair is awesome!
**CONGRADULATIONS & GOOD LUCK!**
That's normal! Just think to yourself "I've got this" and maintain a positive attitude.  I'm sure you'll do great!
The first day of anything always makes me nervous, whether it be school or work or going to a social meet-up.

You'll do great! It will take time to adjust but you will, I promise. Keep your head up and everything will be okay.

Good luck!
You are beautiful, powerful and ready! You have to believe yourself first for others to see that you are ready. I wish you luck!
Good luck. Also, love the 2 buns, they're really cute. And your eyes are gorgeous. Ok, you're just really cute. 

I hope your new job is everything you expected and more. I hope everyone there is really nice, and that the work is fulfilling. I hope you make friends there.
You got this...no worries! Do your best, and that’s what you do.
8h later

How’d it go?
Don’t get fired!
Your hair is so cute and I wish I could do mine like that. Also, I hope your first day went great :)
I'm having first day job jitters too! Let's show them who's boss yeah? We got this!

You're gorgeous too! Which is just a bonus! You're going to rock this new job!
You've got nothing to worry about.  Rest easy.  Get a good night's sleep.  Put your head on your pillow tonight with a smile on your face!  You got this!
Every single person that has ever had a job at some point it was their first day as well. You got this.
Fuckin hell girl. You got this 100%. Heading for promotion already and haven't even started. You look strong and smart, the killer combo. People won't know whether to fear you or fancy you, either way best stay in your good books.
You look nice! Good luck!  :)
As a manager, unless you had a ton of experience at the position you were hired for, I would be concerned if you weren't a little nervous.

It's normal to feel that way - it means you're taking it seriously.
I'm also a writer with anxiety and PTSD! Keep trying to focus on the positive and do what you can to take care of yourself. You'll get through this with time. I know the mental stuff magnifies everything and makes it harder, but know that you're not alone in dealing with it and things will pan out for the better :)
Congrats on the house it's one of the most important parts of your life, and where you'll make a lot more memories so congrats on that! Also if you don't have many friends try talking to your bfs friends it can help a lot! Have a good rest  of your week! :)
Congrats on the new house. And I bet the 2 of you are adorable together. Also, you have the prettiest eyes, and a really nice beard. 

The retail job is just one step of the way to your dreams. It sucks that you got rejected, but don't ever give up. You'll get the dream job one day. 

Here's an internet hug. Everything's going to be fine. I'm also a gay writer with ptsd and anxiety. I am totally willing to listen and offer support.
Yo man. Don’t think too much about the employment. The right job will come along in time.
Your boyfriend and you just took a huge life step in moving in together. Be positive and focus on the great things going on
Your hair is a glorious mess. I mean it looks stylishly messy. It's an impressive mess! It reminds me of a Meg Ryan from When Harry Met Sally. You'd be a great 90s romcom heroine.
If you didn’t get this job then another, better one is waiting for you. No matter how bleak things get, there is always a reason for it and because of that, you’re always exactly where you’re supposed to be in life. As long as you’re being yourself and doing your best, then you’ll always be perfect because you’re exactly who you’re supposed to be.
It's always difficult to go through a trying time in your life and I am sorry to see that you are physically and mentally unwell. Regardless of your state in life, you are incredibly valuable as a human being. No matter what problems you are having, no matter what trials you are going through, you are valuable. It may be hard to see your own value in your valley of trials, but know that you are worth so much more than you can ever know. You have been so strong to carry yourself with all of your burdens, let me encourage you to endure and grow stronger. You are doing a great job. You deserve to feel confident in who you are as a valuable human being. You are a beautiful woman with vibrant eyes,  amazing style, and incredible hair. Keep being your amazing self. I hope you have a wonderful day :)
Stay positive! I got turned down for a job at Ace Hardware AND a job at Amazon (Seriously?) But now I've got one at FedEx making 15 an hour. More options at other companies too! Good work will come your way. Just keep your chin up and keep looking. 😁
It's okay to be sad and overwhelmed; this is a lot to deal with for one person! Take care of yourself and know that things will pass with time and patience.
You look like you can make a playlist for every mood
I really want to give you a hug right now. I hope it gets easier. I hope you feel better, both physically and mentally.
Hey there, give it time.

You're young and there's no rush. Just breathe and take a moment for yourself. There's plenty of jobs out there and you'll find one soon enough.  You're kind but willful as well and you don't need any advice from me aside from a simple reminder to be patient and work on one thing at a time.

&#x200B;

Hang in there. You're not alone. You've got this.
I hope you recover soon! 
Jobs come and jobs go, maybe an even better one will pop up and you discover it was meant to be.
Just keep aiming for whatever you want to do and love, and you’ll be fine!
And continue looking gorgeous while you’re at it, ‘cause you’re super pretty :)
I'm 100% sure you will find another job, you look like someone trustful idk why. Also everyone gets a health problem in his life, you will find a way out :)

You hair looks amazing, beautiful eyes and those glasses are super cuuuute.
Atleast you look cute af! The rest will sort itself out given time.
It may seem tough to not get the job you interviewed for but you got to see it as they did you a favor by not giving you a job who wouldn’t appreciate your effort and experience!!! Don’t let that bring you down when you know your qualified
Are you Emma Stone’s sister? :) You’re beautiful!
On the plus side, you're beautiful, have a very sweet smile, and kind eyes. I'm sure that missing this job just means a better opportunity in the future. Best of luck!
I'm in the same boat on all counts, sometimes I don't know how I manage to stay positive. Just know you're not alone, dear. It can be super stressful when you have health expenses and it feels like you can't get the job you need. I try to convince myself that it takes some courage, facing health issues while also job hunting, but I sometimes struggle to believe it, and think I'm doing nothing worth commending. But seeing you face that struggle, I can see the courage in you. It certainly inspires confidence in me. I hope knowing that you're not alone and that others see you as rather brave can inspire confidence in you too!

Also, my goodness, those eyes are a lovely color. They look teal, I've only once or twice seen quite a lovely blue-green in someones eyes like that.
girl your shitting on these bitches don't let the world bring you down
All I’ve ever wanted to be was a 90s romcom heroine. :)
This is what I’ve been trying to teach myself! It’s so difficult to break my normal way of thinking of what “could” be and what “should” be. Thank you.
How did u know.
Thank you friend.
Thank you. You are absolutely right.
Yea I’m Gemma Pebble.
Well you look like you are living it! Hell with a bit of editing and placement your pic could be on the front of a VHS in Blockbuster alongside a leading man sporting a goofy expression.
Just do it. Don't overthink it. We all go through these. Me included 👍😉
Better than 90s romcom heroin....... .*heroin*
That's why we both spelt it heroine.
I know
 I was kidding around
I'll be honest you look lovely as hell and your jaw doesn't really look swollen. I bet your picture is gonna be fine as fuck.
Even with a swollen jaw, you still have a beautiful smile :)
Well i dont see anything but beauty, i bet your picture looks awesome!
I had a black eye my senior photo - it became a funny story, your swollen jaw will too. Not great pictures are a school right of passage! You are stunningly beautiful right now and you have your whole life ahead of you, look forward to your bright future.
I’d never know you’d just had surgery if you hadn’t said so; don’t worry at all about your picture.

I was in a similar boat when I got my wisdom teeth out, except I also was allergic to the drug they use to induce clotting afterwards, so I ended up bleeding so badly for so long that I nearly ended up in the ER—they ran out of gauze to pad it with, so I was just sitting there and spitting blood into a trash can. On the bright side, the fact that I made it through without any long-term problems means that as long as you follow their directions to prevent infections or anything, you’ll be fine in no time!
Swollen or not, you're still really pretty! Stay cool, keep it positive and things will work out fine. Have an awesome day 😁
When I had my wisdom teeth out, I had to be completely awake, laughing gas wasn't even an option due to an issue some of my family has, so I know exactly what that's like. I hope you can get past the pain and memories, it does get better, and you look gorgeous for your pictures!
I honestly can't really see anything wrong with your jaw.
You look great!
The swollen jaw isn't as noticeable as you think, I wouldn't have known if you didn't tell me. You look nice, have a nice smile, and your senior picture is going to turn out great, especially if you look this nice in an off the cuff verification picture for Reddit.
You now have an epic story to tell-probably could write a horror story about the wisdom teeth. I’ll buy that book!
I would have never noticed that your jaw was swollen. You're beautiful.
Swollen jaw didn’t make you less pretty. You have a nice smile and pretty eyes. Having had multiple oral surgeries myself, I’m certain you feel far worse than you look!
The combo of your awesome u/ and your great message makes me happy, thank you!
So happy for you. I'm glad lifes going well and you can tell by that wonderful, genuine smile you have on your face. You look happy and beautiful and the world is yours to take, keep at it. Xx
Looking good! Stay positive and the good times will keep on coming. You're doing great!
Congratulations :) That’s really a great feeling, and it’s good you take a second to appreciate it!
And don’t worry, you don’t look super tired, to me at least.
In fact, I think you have very beautiful eyes!
If this is you super tired then I'm already jealous!

You're gorgeous and apply makeup better than I ever will! 

I'm glad things are going great! You earned it!
That’s awesome pretty lady. Staying positive even during my worst moments help me power through them.
Everyone deserves to feel good! Thank you for sharing your happy with us, your smile and sweet eyeliner made me happy too.
ugogurl
I'm happy for you! I hope it keeps going well.
You really pull off those glasses! 

I promise that you will find people in your life who will be there for you no matter what you go through. You are worthy of love from people but you should learn to love yourself first and and see yourself for the wonderful person that you are.

Things will get better☺️
You have such lovely hair. 

One thing I’ve learned is that so many friends come and go, so many people are in your life for a short but important time, because life drags you off in different directions, it’s usually no one’s fault, it’s just the way it goes. When you get ones that stay it’s magical, but you can still gain so much from the ones that leave - sometimes it’s wonderful memories, other times it’s valuable lessons. You will find other people that bring you joy and support.
You're getting things done *and* looking that good?  You have a lot to be proud of!  Not to mention that your hair, nails, and makeup game are on point.  Love your style too.  Keep keeping on and good people will be as attracted to you as everyone in this thread (including me) already is.
[removed]
If friends aren’t there for you then they aren’t real friends at all. Don’t blame yourself for someone sometimes finding real friends is hard. Every life is worth so much don’t value yourself by the number of friends
Ok, my go-to compliment is to think of a celebrity that someone looks like, but this one might be a little esoteric.  


There's this lady who works at my public library. I guess most people wouldn't find her conventionally attractive, but she's pretty to me. She has a heart of gold, and has nothing but kindness for everyone she meets. Even irate library goers who yell and have to be thrown out she feels no animosity towards. She hosts this free class to help people with learning disabilities learn how to use a computer. She's easily one of the best people I've ever met.  


Anyway, you remind me of her, and I couldn't think of anyone in the world better to compare you to.
You achieve, build, grow, develop, and change the world. You make yourself and life around you better every day. People are lucky to know you. You are delightful. To you and all that you were, all that you are, and all that you are yet to be... PROST!
Don’t know why your friends leave you. You’re pretty cute in those glasses! :)
I really like your style. You are quite beautiful and you've found a look that works for you.


I'm so sorry that you're going through hard times and I'm always here if you just need to vent.
Your lips are such a beautiful shape! I love your hair colour also! Friends that use you and leave were never friends, I know it hurts petal but you’re better off without them! You’ve got this! X
Awe you look awesome and like a very good person. Hope you find some better people to have in your life. You deserve it.
Hey! I could use a friend for games, I play words with friends with another girl I know daily and it’s a blast. You deserve the best! If they leave it just means that they hit their expiration date, and nobody wants things past expiration lol. You’re too cute to let them get you down.
Dude... Your skin is PERFECT.  I'm super jealous.
First of all, you're more than enough. You're really, really pretty, you're clearly productive and willing to work hard and pull your weight. You're a gem! 

All you need to do is stop letting other people define you and stand on your own. You're plenty strong enough. It will be scary at first, but you CAN cast off those fake friends, you can make real ones who will love and value you the way you deserve. 

Try to stay positive, keep working hard, and look to yourself for confidence first! You are the best friend you can ever have. You can appreciate your hard work, love the way you look, treat yourself right, and make your life better to live. The good friends will come along in time. Stay strong, stay positive. You can do this 💪 We all care about you and we believe in you!
love the hair. try to find something you love to do and  I'm sure everything will fall into place.
I hope you find friends who admire you for the great person you are,  just take deep breaths and know you got this!
If friends only used you so far they're not real and I bet someday you'll find some people that make you as happy as you make other happy. Keep on searching cause they are out there somewhere. And honestly you're definitely not worthless I  any way, everyone worth something even if it hasn't shown or hasn't been appreciated yet so keep on going gurl cause you deserve that big ass happiness that's definitely gonna come your way
Do you have any hobbies? Maybe joining a sport/activity you enjoy doing and acquiring new skills could help improve your self-worth. It could also be a good way to meet new friends with similar interests!
You ain't alone in this kind of shit sadly, a lot of  us in these particular sorts of sub reddits feel overwhelmed, lost, abandoned by people. Don't give in though, believe me I just broke a three year cycle of my own that was abusing the shit out of me, especially in the last 6-8 months. You gotta gut it out, go balls out and make your own path. I destroyed my own cage, the cage I built. It's scary to have to break free of comfort, but I promise you, everything you do, every day, it's noticed by someone. A smile, a small hello, even something as silly as a high five. Create your own happiness, do things that make you feel good. Stop trying to feel good only because of others. Everyone here will carry you when you can't walk, we'll push you when your stagnant, but you need the will to move on your own. Build your fire, stoke your fire and then set that bitch free, let is torch the cage, let it raze the land, and the golden things still left standing, those are what matter.
You’re gorgeous! But beyond that, I hope you can find some quality friends. Apps like Bumble can help, and even social media pages for hobbies or local places you’re a fan of can be a good start. You deserve to have someone in your life you can trust, and that person is looking for you right now as well.
You’re better than the people you surround yourself with.

The people that you think are your “friends” clearly aren’t deserving of your friendship.

You’re worth more than you know, and anyone who doesn’t agree with that, isn’t worth a minute of your time.
I love your look, you seem like a beautiful person, both inside and out. Life is tough, and it's full of learning experiences and stepping stones. I know, I'm in the middle of a bunch of learning experiences now. Please just know that you have value, the people who love you truly do love you, and this too shall pass. If you need to message anyone and talk, whether it be about issues or just about your day, please feel free to send me a message!
People aren't worth your time. Believe me even the oldest of friends tend to bite like snakes once humanity fades away.
Don't be too hard on yourself this time will pass and its better having no friends that only use you.
I'm sure you'll find good friends who love you for who you are.
Nonetheless you always have a friend here and all my friends are your friends too so don't feel too sad or alone ❤
Be happy and lead a happy life Friend. We all love you no matter what and will always love you no matter what ❤
You can message or talk to me in comments if you want a friend
I'm sure that there is someone who cares, and knows you're a lovely woman, you may not see it yourself, but others know.
It sounds like your "friends" are the worthless ones. If they don't value you, they're not worth anything. You are more precious (and beautiful) than you know. Don't let others define your value. You are not worthless. You're priceless.
Good gracious, you look so beautiful. If you were in front of me I would have kissed your forehead. People will use you for their purpose don't let that thing get you. You a beautiful person, just keep doing good and do not expect anything from anyone. Love your hairstyle.
It sucks that you're going through a rough time, but always remember to be kind to yourself and to love yourself. You are enough. You are not worthless. Just because some dumbasses out there don't realize that, doesn't mean you should give up on people or yourself.
This is me. Hopefully we can learn to be positive soon. One thing I’ve been trying to do is find at least one good thing in the day. Even something very small. Anyways. You’re so pretty and I’m jelly of your hair. I miss my long hair and yours is so pretty and healthy looking.
You ain’t worthless
Your hairstyle and glasses really compliment your bone structure!
Your lips are like the perfect size. Perfect
I think you are gorgeous, I'm so proud of you for doing the chores! If you feel a panic attack coming stop and redirect yourself -- what are 2 things I see, what are two things I can touch, what are 2 things I smell, what are 2 things I can hear...sometimes its enough to redirect my mind.
You probably have a pretty nice smile
You've got beautiful skin and lips.
Self worth is something that you need to work for and it’s not something that develops immediately. Look at completing the chores and doing small tasks as little accomplishments; steps along the path. Each step brings another, and you feel better and better about yourself and about life as you progress. 

You sound like a lovely person. If you’ve had bad luck with friends so far, I know you’ll find a good friend (or friends) who lift you up and don’t use/leave you. You don’t need to have a lot of friends; quality over quantity is the goal and I know you’ll find those people in your life soon!
Look into law of attraction! But feel your feelings too release them and then feel the new and good ones!!!
You are worthy and deserving of true friends who treat you with respect. Anything less is just not acceptable. It definitely takes time to recognize the immensity of your worth, but try and give yourself some credit for pulling through despite the cruelties of others. You are stronger than you would ever think! That's something I myself learned from facing similar hardships. And from one gal with glasses to another; you ROCK them!!!
The picture wont load because the internet is bad where I'm at. But I know for sure you are loved by God. He loves you as if there were only you on this earth. He know how talented and smart and beautiful you are. Keep on moving those feet every day.  You'll get to your destination where you'll finally feel how God feels about you.
I find you really beautiful and I'm sure you are loved and you will find something that make you feel worth, because you are :)
You rock those pink nails !  And I love how expressive your glasses are.  People come and go - often enough it has nothing to do with you. Be nice to others but don’t sacrifice yourself. That’s sth I had to learn too. Ppl expect you to always do stuff for them and when you say no they abandon you cause they took what they could.Be true to yourself . Say no more often and say yes only if you can and want to. Be careful to whom you give your time it’s the only thing that never comes back.you deserve better.
First, you're absolutely gorgeous. Second, you deserve to be appreciated. Don't waste time on people who don't value you.
There are alot of crappy people in the world. But there are alot of great ones too. Though it's hard, try to remember that people who have gone in and out of your life may have been awful but their awfulness was not because of you. You are enough!!
It should be a blessing they are out of your life, you don’t want fake friends. The true ones will stay even at the hardest of times. Things will get better.
That sounds *extremely* difficult, and I only somewhat know how that feels, because I had a tendency to be destructive with my past friendships. But I'm sorry you have to deal with that. I'm happy to see you're seeking us out because we want to let you know that you *are* worth friendship, irregardless of the current state of things *exactly* as they are right now. 

I love your hair, too. And you are cute, too. I hope that you will find people who are solid, dependable friends. I think oftentimes while we're younger, people are hardly dependable, at least in my experience. But at least here we can show you love and reassurance as I'm sure you deserve, even though I don't know you at all. 

I'm not sure what exactly I could say to you other than that I'm certain you will have a group of friends that appreciates and recognizes you. It takes time for these things to happen, too. I'm only just discovering people almost every other weekend it seems like that could potentially be friends. It's a rare thing to have a group of solid friends arise out of small experiences with other people. 

But I know you will be okay. :) You will. You deserve goodness from people and good friends.
Don’t worry about people who use you. It’s just a poor reflection on them. If you’re looking for real friends, you can PM alot of people on reddit, who’ll enjoy your conversation, including me. Your skin is really great. Take care of yourself. You’re worth more than you know.
I’m so sorry to hear this sweetie. I think you are adorable and I’m sending you a mom hug. Everyone needs a mom hug. 🤗
You look like a wonderful person to hang around with. Keeping it real like that. How do u manage to do work n still pull of that look. Dw dear friends will surely come along.
If I've learnt anything on reddit, it's that you can't fix others or have them fix you. Focus on yourself and hope for the best. I believe you can do this!!
I’m nearly 30 and I find that finding good friends is really hard for a lot of people. Luckily it’s easy to find friends on reddit as you’ll find a few like minded people. Good luck 💕
Panic attacks suck, but they’re 0.01% of your time on this earth. 

The rest of the time you’re a gorgeous woman with a beautiful life.

You deserve happiness. You’ll get it.
GORGEOUS!!!!!!!!!!!
Be enough for yourself ❤ at the end of the day thats all thats gonna matter.
You are worth it!!
You're not alone, dear, it's tough when friends do that, I know. You're just of a more loyal calibur of person than average, and you love your friends dearly and deeply. It's a good thing. It doesn't mean you aren't enough, it means they didn't deserve you. Eventually friends like us find each other, and we become lifelong friends. You'll find yours one day, just don't lose heart. Not that you could lose a heart that big :)
Just a simple one, but your bangs are absolutely perfect. I've never seen such lovely, even, well-kept bangs.
I see no one but a beautiful young woman. Period.
Being taken advantage of means you are all heart and your friends have none.

You’ll find quality friends in no time. I don’t know about you but I used to have the Disease to Please and my “friends” used me constantly. I stopped hanging out with them and kept my small group of close friends closer.
I LOVE your look. 

Trust me girl, I have been there. I recently learned that I am on the Autism spectrum, and that people take advantage of me without me ever realizing it (which feels awful, btw). 

All you can do is learn and grow from shitty life experiences, and learn how to do things differently. Good luck to you!
I'm no expert but try not to focus on people. Find something you love and get good at it, they will come
You look really nice!  (I just had a similar conversation with my step-mom 90 minutes tree es ago!)  Real friends try to give more than they take. I have many aquantences, few friends, but that's okay!  People leave. Friends try to stay in touch.
You are not alone! Don't worry!
God loves you, personally.  He made you for a wonderful life and a personal relationship.  God doesn't make mistakes. Therefore, you are awesome!  You are worth so much that God sacrificed his only child to pay the penalty for any of your mistakes,  so that you could have a wonderful forever! It's impossible that you could be any more valuable than that!
How people treat you is not indicative of your worth. You are a unique human being with strengths and values. There are good people out there who will treat you with respect and bring out the best in you. Unfortunately they aren't as common, but they are out there. And I hope you meet one soon.
Your hair is gorgeous! The color is stunning and it’s so long! Ever since I’ve worn glasses I’ve wanted to be able to pull of the style of glasses you have, but they’ve never looked good on me. They look great on you! They bring out your eyes and makeup. Also your earrings are really pretty!
Man, you have the ability to make some new friends. Better friends who like you for you!

Also, your hair is stunning!
You didn’t even have to post a picture. 

You are an amazing person. Unique. 

You are beautifully a value to everyone around you.

You are the best. A treasure. Smile.
Wow, you are so beautiful!
You are definitely not worthless , beautiful but not worthless. Real friends can come from afar or be as close  as down the street screen them before you get too close.
You have a pretty face, you will meet someone that will love you forever
They may not be the right friends. It is in no way your problem. I hope you can feel appreciated someday. I hope you can find some awesome people. 

Also, I love your hair, I love your glasses, You're really cute.
You're so purty
You’re sensitive and that’s a great thing to be. A woman who can be hurt by others and still remain gentle is a gem. You’ll find people who adore you and in the meantime love yourself because you’re special and deserving.
Life sucks.  But everyone around you is thinking the same so you’re not alone.  We’re all suffering together each one of us.
Your hair is beautiful! You rock your own look, and that’s cool! Don’t let people get you down, there’s a fine line between friends and fiends, and when you get a good one...they won’t mess with ya, they’re around for all the good and the bad. A lucky person is a person who at the end of their life can realistically say they have 5 core people they can count on...all the rest are just acquaintances...you got this!
Hi there! I just want to let you know you're awesome. Don't let outside circunstances like friends not being kind to you make you lose sight of that. I can tell that your sweet and empathetic, and probably a really great friend to have 😄 and be gentle with yourself, because it may feel bad, but it's just the universes way of putting you on the track to find friends who will grow with you, and stick around for the Long haul. Much love friend, keep your head up.
Your glasses are cool af 👍🏼
You’re a pretty lady with some really powerful glasses! 

Friends can be tough, for we sentimental types are constantly betrayed, as far as we’re concerned. The actions of others do not dictate your worth! 

Breathe! Things will settle down, or heat up, as you are ready for it and need it. 

Hang in there! #catpicture
You look really beautiful.
U have beautiful lips
Love your glasses!
Dammm why are all the eligible singles complete strangers to me haha. Single, worthless and used over here too girl. Just find someone like you, takes a while.

Oh and the toast, you have awfully pretty lips with little curly bits in the corner <3
You take care of your facial appearance really well. Hats off.
[removed]
How about you do for you, show people that you are more than capable of handling your yourself. Say no to helping once in a while, though politely.  Allow them to realise that you wont always be there to benefit them.
Congrats on doing chores. Also nice hair color.
[removed]
Let me start off by saying that I totally get that you're coming from a good place with your comments, but you are violating one of our rules, which is no advice, unless the OP asks for it. 

I get that you're trying to help and get to the bottom of an issue, but you are making assumptions about OP, which is unfair and not the point of the sub, and against the wishes of the OP. I would ask you message the mods about concerns you have about our posters in the future. Please don't take this in a harsh way, but comments removed.
[removed]
Also you got 27 upvoats, are you happy? That many people agree with you that i should not post here, okay, i wont.
This is one of the best things I have read in a while. It's heartwarming to know that people like her don't go unnoticed. You're really awesome
not appropriate for this sub.
You can do better of a toast than that.
Sorry. Noted.
Chill
[removed]
I really don't think that was what they was going for, not for you to stop posting, but when you need a toast to let it stay. If you delete it, you can never look back on what was said, advice that truly could have helped you, etc.. It really seems like you're struggling with social issues and depression, and I completely feel for you on those topics, I've dealt with them in my personal life, they are horrific. I don't know what you're going through, but that's what it seems to me. I haven't been on this subreddit long, but a lot of people on here seem more than willing to talk about it all with you that could offer way more help than I ever could. I hope you read this message and feel just a bit better, knowing that a stranger on the internet cares and would like to help. Also, and it may be hard, but smile a bit. You really look like your smile could make the sun jealous with its shine!
I think the upvotes are more for the desire to help you, rather than having you post somewhere else.
You can absolutely post here. That is what this place is for.
You can post here and should when you want too.
Bruhhh come onnnn you posted on one of THE nicest subreddits out there how could you think people don’t care about you specifically?? Nobody cares about karma really it’s just a tool to show which comment is relatable with randoms on reddit. Just chill take a deep breath and dm some of these lovely people if you would like to talk more in depth.
Unfortunately people on reddit down vote just to down vote. Try not to take it personally
Sorry, I’m not good at this
You really do have an adorable smile! 
And somehow, you really seem like a genuinely friendly person (you give off good vibes).

I’m sure your stutter mainly bothers you, but is endearing to others.
Especially to the ones that (will) matter!

Stay true to yourself and I’m confident you’re the kinda guy who can make it in life, whatever making it means to you :)
hey man ! we all go thru life at different paces. there's no written law that you MUST be employed by 26 and MUST be in a relationship. don't be so hard on yourself! 

hang in there! better days are just around the corner
No, you’re awesome
you are a young T Rex my friend. misunderstand but when the time is right you'll rule the roost. stay cool my friend.
Stutters are cute, you look cute, you have a nice smile and there is nothing wrong with you in any way, this is the wrong place for you, and you should know that!
Try a dating app, go out, and most important, build your self confidence, although it's tricky, you can do it!

Have a wonderful day 👍
You’ve got a really nice smile— in fact you have folds on your cheeks from smiling! Tbh that’s adorable.
What employment would you prefer to be doing now?
I don't see any of that, man. I see what looks like a kind, caring guy with a good heart. Confidence lies within. You gotta remember that as long as you're challenging yourself, fighting to be your best, you're awesome. You deserve love and respect the same as everyone else, you're just as valuable as the rest of us. Work hard, shine bright, and everything else will come in time. Stay strong, and good luck!
Fairly or not I always think of a stutter as a sign that someone is smart and excited, two lovely things to be. So when I hear someone with a stutter I think they are an interesting person from the get go. 

Lots good will be ahead for you.
Sometimes finding a job can be difficult and just because you have a stutter doesn’t mean it measures your intelligence. Push through and try and try and try and you will succeed life can be a tough road but it’s harder if you start giving up
You have a gorgeous smile!:D
I often worry this will sound condescending, but I find stutters endearing. The people who matter to you will be patient with it and love you and your (amazing) smile for who you are.
You're awesome too! I know the feeling of not feeling confident all too well, but you can definitely get there! Life can just be super tough sometimes but you hold the strength to pull through! We on this sub believe in you! X
I agree with all the others...stutters are endearing! You have a great smile and seem to have such a positive energy about you! If I saw you irl, I’d totally give you a wink ;) you’re doing a good job, buddy. It’ll get better.
First of all you look bomb as fuck mate, don't let anyone tell you otherwise. And your stutter just makes you more unique, which is always a really lovely thing in my opinion. You'll definitely find a good person to spend your life with, I'll bet my whole paycheck I it. Yeah this sub is quite awesome but you're breathtaking dude
You’re a beautiful person and you deserve love and happiness. The world is a better place because you’re in it. Look at that smile! Also, you have lovely eyes.
If we're awesome, and you're one of us. Then you too are awesome! 

Keep your head up man. Don't worry about not having a partner. Focus on things you enjoy and surround yourself with people with similar values. You seem like a smart guy, I'm sure you'll figure yourself out.
You just look like a really nice person. Like if I just walked by you somewhere, I’d think “he’s probably really nice”.
You're handsome bro! You look like a younger Jason Statham 👍😉
I have a stutter too! We’re made for each other!

Seriously tho. You’re really handsome and have such a sweet smile. Chin up, you’ll get through this. Best of luck for your future ❤️
Hey man I’ve been where you’re at. Don’t get caught up worrying about where you’re at in life, and know that many people take different paths forward. You’re a good looking guy and you’ll eventually find the right person!
Hi. I instantly liked your smile. You look a bit like my son. You will do great when you find a Job that fits you because people will see what a good Person and worker you are.
You look a bit shy but that makes you more endearing. And when you find a relationship that person will see just how amazing you are.
Dont be down, everything will be alright.
Sorry for bad english, it's not my first language
Bro you should definitely do cosplay
You have an amazing smile! Plus your stutter wont matter to people who do care about you!
Edit:Spelling!
Keep going. You will find the dream job. You will find your soul mate. Sure, there will be a little bit of trial and error on both, but it will happen.
You didn't stutter at all in that title!
Hey man, there’s a big economic slump right now. I know a ton of people that are unemployed. My nephew had apraxia and slight stutter and I saw how difficult it was for him. I think a stutter is not the barrier AT ALL to a relationship, so while it’s hard to tell you not to think about it, I wouldn’t dwell on it. A good person will love you stutter or not. They may even find it charming. You also have a very cute face. If I can make one more suggestion, I’d look at new glasses once you’re in a situation where you’re able to afford them:) Zenni has good prices. Your glasses are great, I just think glasses where you could see your face more or ones that are bold would like nice too. 

Either way, you’re great :)
Heyboy I'm a fella so I will leave out the handsome smile chat. Just to let you know I'm where you are but 30 and it'll be alright. Just knuckle down, appreciate the little things and when the good times come, enjoy them.

Nothing about you will hold you back. Persistence will get you anywhere.
I came here to comment something original, but this person said everything I was thinking, probably more eloquently. Only thing I have to add is that you seem pretty handsome, and being bald suits you :)
Something with computers. I've thought about going to college multiple times but the thought of being thousands of dollars in debt because of student loans always puts me off of it. Maybe I just shouldn't worry about that and just go for it.
I can confirm this. The friends I do have that mean a lot to me are patient and understand that I have a stutter. They try not to talk over me but still do from time to time, which is understandable. It seriously means a lot to me when people are like this. Thank you!
Go into some of your state's colleges, even community colleges and price it up, compare, and talk to the counselors and see if there are any grants that you can apply for. You can get ready for your degree path by taking just a  couple classes that would count toward a degree *now*, and start now applying for grants for next year. This will also help get you accustomed to being in school again. 

&#x200B;

During this year of fewer classes, you say you have a stutter, go to a speech therapist and work on that. Getting a degree in computers would be such a satisfying accomplishment, and then hunting for a job. After you get that degree, maybe even moving and starting fresh somewhere in a big city with a big company with lots of employees to befriend. 

&#x200B;

Here you have put a pic of yourself online and asked for advice. That takes *guts.* There's only one person standing in your way. Take those guts and be the change you want.
I was afraid to get student loans, too, but they allowed me to get the degree and therefore the job I wanted, so it was worth it. The fear never leaves, but you are stronger than your fear!
Edit: spelling
What kinda idiot girls are you going after dude?
You're hot! That first pic in the comment above particularly... The red flannel and brown t-shirt... I don't know what it is... Jawline? Something reminds me of a young Reznor swoon worthy really.

Physical attributes aside I did look through your comments and you're a very sweet and sincere guy as well... ❤️
I think you’re a good looking dude and I dig your style! You seem really nice, respectful, easy to talk to—overall, a rare kind of guy to find nowadays. Those girls who have ghosted you are the ones who are missing out (:
Sorry people have been ghosting you... it’s so rude imo. Sometimes people are too focused on themselves to realize how they effect others ya know. I’m so sorry you feel lonely and unloved, I’m so so sure there are people out here that love you and want you around more! Dating is really hard and sometimes can take a long time before something clicks. You’re a handsome guy and I love your style! Especially love the beanie and flannel combo :) I’m sure you’ll find someone who is head over heels for you soon! If you ever need a friend or Even just someone to talk to feel free to shoot me a message I’m always on reddit haha! I hope you have a great week :3
you have style and flair. the wild hair and shirt tells me all. stop slouching and be that alpha beast of the wild.
You honestly have a face that looks like a classical painting, and your style really suits you. 

I’m sorry that people have ghosted you, that’s genuinely bad behaviour of theirs.  Don’t give up though, someone’s out there who will make you smile.
Those girls probably don't know what they're missing out on. You look handsome, have awesome hair(I'm kinda jealous tbh) and I bet my ass you have the goodest heart around. Keep going, do your thing. You'll be happy and loved someday cause you deserve it buddy
Aw man, if I saw you walking around (and had any confidence in my ability to form proper sentences in front of new people) I so would approach you, in a heartbeat. You have that certain laid-back grunge-y style, which I absolutely adore, and I know for a fact I am not the only girl who'd find it extremely appealing.

You are not unloved, useless or unwanted, this is just a way in which *you* perceive yourself, based on your own criticism, as well as those bad experiences that took a toll on your self-confidence. 

It honestly broke my heart a bit to read this, because I feel I often do the same to myself. And it is so incredibly hurtful, because you spend your every waking hour in your own head and there is nowhere to hide really, from those cold allegations. 

And yet I don't think it has to be that way. You are seeking for someone to love you and to give you affection, but for a person who can not really accept themself it's always going to be quite the scary, lonely world. Other people can make you feel that kind of beautiful love and security, but oftentimes when you feel you're becoming attached to your person, the gap between you two grows as one's growing intensity does not quite match the other's. I don't know if this is accurate to you but this is how I have always found relationships to be. Only once in my life have I found an incredible balance between two separate people's minds, and it really did blow my mind. I know you can find it too! That kind of person exists for you, your person, many of them quite possibly, but you just haven't had the chance to get to know them yet. I know that's kind of a cliche thing to say, maybe, but it seems to be true from my viewpoint. 

Sending you a big squeeze and lots of kisses! You *are* wanted and you do have worth, so much so. I hope you'll start feeling better soon, and I wish all wonderful things to happen in your life. <3

I've been exactly where you were. There is a light at the end of the tunnel. Through my experience, I found out that if I didn't worry at all about meeting someone or being in a relationship, that I'd be much happier. So I adopted the policy of "Don't give a damn." So that's exactly what I did and I started doing and experiencing things without worrying about what other people thought. Basically live your life and don't worry about it. Why? Because when you're happy, you're confident, and when you're confident, you're attractive, and when you're attractive................well....the females will start noticing you more and that's when things change. You're already a good looking dude so your foundation is all set. You're not working from zero, you know? So enjoy life and don't worry so much.
Hey friend! You're a good lookin guy, you have a nice hipster-but-one-who-is-cool-and-not-pretentious look. So, I dunno what's going on with the ladies. I've been in a similar place- looooong dry spell, wondering what's wrong with me- all I can say is keep trying and learn from your mistakes. And those mistakes may be the people you are picking, not anything about you or what you're doing. Take care of yourself man!
I don't get many opportunities tbh.. whoever fancies me, i suppose. 🤔

Thank you for saying that
Buddy, my heart can’t take your beauty. Holy macaroni, you’re a goddess. I have actual heart eyes right now. Wow.
You have absolutely stunning eyes, they draw a person in.
You’re beautiful, your makeup is perfect, and your skin is flawless!
You have so many beautiful features 😍 Those eyes, that beautiful complexion and coloring!  I've always considered that dark hair and fair complexion especially striking 🙂
Well I did a bit of homework (ie.. looked at a few posts and read a few comments) and - 

It sounds like work is bringing you down. And I hear you, I really really do. Things WILL get better, because it sounds like you're doing ok otherwise. Try to keep your interests up and find passion in what you can still do and excitement for what you'll be able to do eventually. 

As per the confidence boost: 

You're stunning! 
The dark hair pulled back w those sparkling eyes? Beautiful. You have great skin and know enough about makeup to accent already beautiful features. 

You're also hella brave! Aerial stuff is no joke and that pic of you is fucking fierce. Put that in a frame and own your badassery. 

You sound like a wonderful soul. 
You help people and offer your help and advice. 
Good. For. You. We need more of you in the world.
I need to know what lipstick that is because it's amazing
You are so gorgeous! I love that lipstick on you, it’s so flattering! You also have beautiful eyes! You’re totally rocking it girl! :3
As my Grandma would say, you're a knockout! I bet you are special in a bunch of other ways too ❤️
My goodness you are so gorgeous! Your skin looks amazing and your eyes are stunning! I hope everything is going well for you!
You, Madam, have a regal presence and are an indelible beauty.  You should be so proud of yourself accomplishment in becoming an acrobat.  That must take immense talent and fortitude.  You really are incredible and I can't begin to tell you how impressed I am.  I'm sorry that you're currently experiencing health problems.  I saw your appeal for a friend here on Reddit, and I would be so honored if that friend were me.  If you'd ever like to chat, feel free to PM me.
your eyes!!! they’re beautiful!!!
At first I was struck by how much of the world your eyes hold, but I always try to remember that none of us really know anything about life. You're doing just fine, dear. Life is an organic dance, not line-dancing!
You've got a face that an artist would gladly spend hours painting a replica of. Your eyes are mesmerising.
You are very gorgeous!! I love the minimalist style you have in this picture, the lipstick really brings out your eyes!! I hope you feel as beautiful as you are ♡
Look at those gorgeous eyes 😍
WHAT A GORGEOUS QUEEN! You are so beautiful!
Why do you need a confidence boost? No one with such beauty should need such thing, you should know the truth, that you look fabulous!

Go out and enjoy the summer, show off that pretty face!
I really love the color of your eyes, you look amazing. I hope you're doing well and have a great day!
Your eyes are beautiful
You look stunning!
Your eye shape and -colour are both beautiful, your eyebrows are on point, you have a cute nose, and that colour looks great on your lips!
You are gorgeous.
My literal first thought when I saw your face was "holy crap those eeyees"
You are absolutely beautiful and have amazing eyes!!!
Your eyes are truly stunning!! Keep your head up and shine your way through the day.  😊
I agree with many of my fellow Toasters. BEAUTIFUL eyes, truly. Great skin, great makeup. You're a catch, for real! Get out there, be strong, be confident in yourself, and be kind! You have a lot of good things coming your way. Have a great day 😁
Your lipstick and brow game is amazing. Also I'm super jealous of your ability as an aerialist. You look great and you have cool hobbies. Plus you help out and offer advice to other people who are struggling. You're a good person.
Holy moly. You are so beautiful!😍😍😍 Your eyes are so pretty, and your eyebrows are my eyebrow goals!
The way you do your makeup is so lovely! You've got a talent for it. And this may be a small thing, but your handwriting has a lot of character and is nice and clean, which is a great random quality for a person haha. I hope your day today is going well and you manage to find the best in your week :)
You're beautiful.
Ofra Liquid lipstick in Santorini! 💕
You have an infectious smile, and you rock this piercings better than anyone i have seen, and I am not a fan of piercings.
Your hair color also really suits you!
You should have nothing to hate about yourself when you are such a bright and good looking person!
😍
Hey just had to say that you have fucking amazing eyebrows 😊 Honestly my eye never goes to eyebrows and I never even know how to style my own but wow yours are perfect for your face shape and give such a warm look to your eyes. Sorry it's so random but I had to say something. Hope you're having a nice day! 👌
You look great! 
Your eyebrows and eyes look fantastic, and you have a great smile.
Don’t be afraid to show it ever 

And also, you’ll be okay!
No matter how stressed you are right now, eventually everything will fall into place.
Keep it up
You look so warm and friendly. I bet you’re a really good friend to those around you.
I love your smile and you look like you give amazing hugs. Persevere with college! You are so much smarter and stronger than you know.
You look like the best person to hang out with and have some laughs, nice smile and radiating with good vibes.
You have a warm smile and clear sense of personal identity -- those two things will get you far in life! College is tough but I'm sure you're smart and capable of doing things that are difficult. Be extra kind to yourself during the stressful times :)
I’m crying in the club❤️
Thanks a ton beautiful
Hey, OP, I hope you don't mind that I put a trigger warning on your post. I wish you the very best in recovery, you're an amazing person for having the strength to seek treatment and I'm so very glad you are with us. 

Rule #1 (be kind) will be strictly enforced on this post, y'all.
You've now survived death, you're a bad ass, remember going forward when you feel like you can't beat the odds... You beat death
You’re doing good. You are strong and you can get thru this. You matter.
I hope that you are okay and that treatment will help you. You deserve better than this, and I wish you luck.

 Also a PSA: please never attempt suicide, but do not try overdosing on NSAIDS because they will almost never work and you will need to have your stomach pumped. You could go into a coma. You also will probably have considerable and possibly permanent damage to your organs from internal bleeding. Please call a suicide hotline instead.
This world is better with you in it, glad you're still here.
Keep your head up. You are strong and you are loved. Best of luck to you ❤️
I’m so sorry this happened to you :( stay strong friendo
Your life is precious and you always have another solution. I’m happy that your still alive please don’t ever waste your life. There are people who need you and if you need anyone the people of reddit are here. If you need to vent DM me!
i had a v similar experience. wasnt voluntary for the psych ward after so hope youll have a better time since you want to be there!
Oh my dear, I’m so sorry that happened but I’m
Awfully happy you’re still with us. You have a friend right here if you ever need one!
I'm wishing for a quick recovery. I know you can get through this. I'm happy you're getting help. I hope it works.
Oh heeyyy, post yours and her name too.  I want to send you both gifts.
well you both look movie star pretty hope the hospital helps with the depression
Its surreal from time to time and all seem worthless but remember in those times that life is a miracle and each day gonna pass faster than the last our time is very limited we dont need to shorten that. If the pain overwhelmes your sould remember that existence is a flash in the infinity of time itself. Dont give up yet try to find purpose.
I've been there. Being in the mental health hospital was really helpful and healing for me. I hope that you will have a similar experience. There's a reason you're still here. Shine bright, beautiful warrior. You have much ahead of you.
You are an amazing person. I wish you all the best in life to come!
You have very beautiful eyes.  I'm really glad you're okay and hope everything goes well. I believe in you and won't stop doing so
I’m so glad youre still here! I hope you have a speedy recovery and start to feel better soon! If you ever ever need a friend or someone to talk to please reach out and I’ll be here as a friend or just a listening ear. I’m so glad you’re on track to get better. I’m sending you such good vibes and positivity right now. 💜
You are worthy. Sending so much love to you!
Wishing you a speedy recovery!! Thank you for still being here.
You're so much stronger than you think you might be right now. YOU are amazing, beauiful, and have so much to live for. If you're a fan of Game of Thrones, just know that Arya Stark has nothing on you. Somewhere, a little part of you said "Not today" and I hope you continue to say that to the negativity and downsides of life, you beautiful human being.
I’m so sorry that you were in that position, but you’re doing an incredibly brave thing. I wish you all the best in life!
I can't add to all the kind words already said...so many caring toasters in here!

But I can add this... Almost died back in 2003 due to an act of violence (terrorists).  Sometimes, I wish I did die.  On those days, I play happy music and think good thoughts.  I survived my awful event.  You'll survive this.  Life, even on the bad days, is better than the alternative.

You are strong and the world needs you in it.  This sub-reddit, every member, wants to hear from you during your recovery.

Get better.  Post again soon so we can toast your recovery and your inner strength. You are loved.
Congratulations on taking the first steps for self help, after having hit rock bottom. It is a long hard road, but the first step in the right direction is the hardest. Every step after this brings more momentum. You’ve got the strength to start the journey, you’ve got the strength to see it through. Your story isn’t over.
I know you are as beautiful inside as you are outside,  and I know you are strong and can make it threw this and I'm glad you are getting help,  don't ever feel like you are in a situation like that and you have no one to talk to,  if you are ever feeling that way again or just need to vent feel free to message me... and there are plenty of subreddits on here that can help, keep your head up!
I don't know what's your pain, but I wish nothing but the bestest recovery. Life can be painful but you have so much to live for. You're a beautiful soul in and out.
Hello I hope you will feel better soon.  I'm sorry you are sad xx x
You're seeking help, which is the first and hardest step. Know that you are beautiful, you have value, and you have the potential to make the world a better place. Keep working, keep fighting, and the sun will rise. You have my word. Stay strong ♥️ We care about you and we will always be here for you.
Proud of you for going to get help, I’ve benefited greatly from therapy and being put on medication. Hang in there, everything takes a bit of time.
You have been through hell... 
You are so brave for seeking help, accepting it.

It is not a fatality, feeling that bad is not a fatality. 
With help, with time, you ll feel better.
With help, and time, You ll learn to look at yourself with kindness, and love, because everyone deserve to see that in themselves. 


I really wish you all the best, I hope you are surrounded, loved. 
Stay strong, cause you are strong, hold on, some days will suck. Some days won't. You'll find that balance. It will get better.
As someone who’s been in a similar situation, I promise it won’t always be like this. I won’t tell you some bullshit like “it’ll get better!” (because I hate that) but I will say that there will be better days, later on. 
I’m so glad you survived, and I hope that someday you can look back on this and be happy that you lived too. I’m sending so much love your way, just think of the things you’ll get to see and do when you get out of inpatient! 
For me it was cats, climbing, baths, and mashed potatoes. 
If you ever need someone to listen, Ive been there and a message is always welcome.
The worlds a rough place but it looks like your body isn't ready to give in, you cleary have the tenacity to keep kicking!

You conquered the coffin now live life!

The world needs you & people need you!

You can do this!!
Oh sweetheart, I'm so glad you made it. Nearly lost a sister to this once, and I've been there myself, though not that method. I'm pretty familiar with the pain around all this. It takes a good deal of bravery to keep going, and definitely takes some courage to reach out for that level of help, so you should feel proud of yourself for doing so. I know it doesn't look or feel like this will end right now, but you'll come out on the other side of all of this, and see how worth it the struggle was. You are loved, dear.
Though I never folloed through with actions, there was a period in my life where I felt no desire or motivation to live. I know it may or may not help, because honestly it only did so much for me when I was suicidal, but please know that you are very deeply loved. It's good that you're seeking help though;  a lot of people would refuse out of pride. Take care, my dear friend, and if you ever need someone to talk to, you're always welcome to PM me.
The reason you did not succeed is because you are destined to something greater. 

Take the time you need for self healing, and keep your chin up. You will prevail over this all. I believe in you.
You look so beautiful. You look so thoughtful.

I am very depressed any have tried the deed before. I dont understand, I truly don't know why.

I wish you nothing but the best in truly defeating your demons.

You can have a happy life. You deserve happiness and smile faces.


PM me if you ever just want to chat to someone.
Remember your life is not your own to take. It belongs to God and He loves you more than you can love yourself.
“You cant kill me, i cant even do that!”
Whose name? That’s both me!
Hang in there - I know those words don’t mean much when you are in the middle of fighting a bout of depression but give it a little time and things will improve. 

I know you have some strong willpower just by the fact you hung in there and got your teaching degree at 40. Continuing education later in life is something a lot of people talk about but not as many are able to actually follow through on because it takes some real effort. You did this and should see that as a strength of yours regardless of if it’s been a nightmare so far. Teaching puts you in a position to be an inspiration to others even if it’s on a small scale, so you are doing some good in this world, don’t let the depression fool you into thinking otherwise.
You’re doing a good job, buddy. I’m proud of you for trying every day, even if it feels like nothing is going right. You have a very kind face and I like your eyes. They’re very expressive. I hope you keep your chin up!
Teaching is a noble profession! It takes a big heart, a smart brain and a desire to make a difference. Those are awesome qualities that you possess friend!  Getting your degree at 40 is also pretty awesome! Nightmares don’t last forever- you’ll wake up soon:)
You must have a big heart if you have your teaching degree. Also, you look like Rainn Wilson's handsome twin brother. Please hang in there, man.
I really like your hair and your beard, they are very nice!! Your glasses go with your handsome face very well, good choice!! I hope you can find a good job with your new degree, congrats on it by the way! It's not easy to finish studying, I'm very proud of you ♡
Your beard is majestic!
You look like the type of guy that would be a great teacher, go be your best :)
Getting a degree is such an achievement, especially when you’ve done it as someone a bit older juggling the commitments and experiences we don’t have in our late teens. It’s really something to be proud of. 

And teaching is such a caring profession, wanting the responsibility to educate children and help them grow into their future selves is so noble and shows you have a huge heart and a clever mind. 

Depression will tell you otherwise, and it sucks because of it, but you’re doing an amazing job.
Please don't give up hope, I bet you are an amazing teacher as long as you keep your heart in it, just try and do your best and if it just an obstacle you just can absolutely not overcome school wise than just look for a better working environment,  keep your head up and I hope you have a great week!
I just finished my first year teaching! Don't get discouraged. There's a student out there that needs an educator like you. You're going to make a huge difference someday, but you just have to keep going! Welcome to one of the most fulfilling careers there is!
I would seek you out as a teacher if I were still a student because you come across as the kind of teacher who cares a lot and wants to be sure your students learn. I'd appreciate your commitment and what I suspect is a kinda quirky outlook on life. I bet you've made a difference in a lot of students' lives and don't even know it.
Depression is so hard; I'm so proud of you for getting your degree and making progress through all the difficulty that comes with that. Keep doing what you can to move in the direction you want to go; you're doing amazing so far!
I’m a professor at a state college, and it breaks my heart to see this happen to my students - think of every night you stayed up late to finish a project, or to write a last minute paper, or to study for an exam. Think of every awkward presentation you survived and  all the annoying group projects. People who say you’re bright may be right, but what’s more important than being bright is being dedicated and persistent and trying so damn hard it hurts. I’m sorry you feel so tired, and I’m sorry it probably feels like you came all this way for nothing. But you’re someone who deserves the life you want. If that means taking a break for your mental health to come back stronger, ok. If that means being careful and pushing through, ok. If that means you’re satisfied where you’re at, that’s ok too. Nobody else gets to tell you where you want to go - you have the agency and aptitude and ability to do whatever it takes to make you happy. I hope things start feeling better for you soon
You right the date like a civilised individual. That says a lot on its own
“I’m a bright girl BUT I just feel like a tired girl”

Bright and tired aren’t opposites, you’re probably both. Just take a break or a gap year or something and come back at it fresh, you got this!
Not finishing your degree is okay. Finishing your degree is okay. You are your priority - do what is best for you.

If university is hurting you more than helping take a break, come back later, find a different university/ college/ program. This is YOUR choose your own adventure and YOU are the heroine.
You only have 2 papers left. You're so close. You can do it.
It’s okay to take a break if you need it. I took a break too to gain clarity and life knowledge, and I’m so so glad I did. You can go back when you feel ready! It’s ok to focus on yourself and get yourself in the right headspace to complete college. If you’re that close now then it’ll be that much easier to go back when you’re ready. I hope you feel a little less tired and more motivated soon because I know you’ve got this! If you ever need a friend you can always reach out to me! Otherwise have a really wonderful week :3
Fuck that! Go do what you love. If you are happy with a fast food job, stay! If you’ll be happier with a job pertaining to your major, get after it! You look happy in the pic, so do whatever made you feel like this.
Finish uni...you can do it!
Do what you need to feel healthy. I want to tell you to get those two papers done - it’s just two more - but you know what you need to feel healthy. 

Even if you don’t go ahead with those papers, life isn’t over, your future is still so full of promise and opportunity. 

Look after yourself.
Everyone struggles sometimes! Things might be hard right now, but those times come and go. Things will get better. Work hard, persevere, and stay positive. You're going to do just fine! Remember that we're all here for you and we believe in you!
You can be both incredibly bright, awesome, etc, and still be tired and deserve a well-needed break! You've got classes and experience under your belt and can always pick back up someday if that's the right path for you. Do what you need to pursue what fits you best; in time things will work out. You have every right to rest and prioritize yourself as long as you need to; we believe in you!
I feel that burn out, friend. That tiredness is familiar to me. You're so damn close though, please don't give up now! You deserve way better than some pizza place, and the world deserves to see what your talents can do!
Your facial features are adorable! Everything from your lips to your eyes, there is that soft feminine glow. The bangs suit you very well and I love how you did your eye makeup. Wish I could get my wings that sharp.
You are adorable! You remind me of Zoey deschanel (newgirl era) or Lily Allen, you have such cute features! The doe eyes, the cute lips, the button nose. And you have great eyeliner too!
You are really cute. You really pull off those bangs. Also, you have beautiful eyes.
The bangs and eyeliner is a hell of a look -  love it. Life is about momentum, and I’m so glad to hear that you’re feeling it start to pick up!
You look amazing!!
Hey you look great dont know how you usualy look but i agree cute and powerfull. Whatever you wanna archive i believe you can do it.
Kinda cute? Super cute.
Fantastic eye makeup!  And your bangs are too cute!
Totally cute! You have a very pretty face and your eyes have a sincerely deep look to them!
I seriously love your look! I wish I could get my wings that sharp and smooth! I also love love love your bangs on you! They really compliment your features! You’re super cute! I hope you have a really great day!
Woah. Anyone tell you that you kinda look like Rashida Jones from the movie, "I Love You Man"?
Dayum. Bundle of Cuteness😘
Your features are super cute! Love the make-up and the bangs as well
You should feel *hella* cute girl!
You are incredibly cute...love the entire look..it’s a very natural look that is simple alluring and still showing your personality.
You are ridiculously adorable!
You are beautiful in that picture!! Such pretty eyes, I hope your day is amazing!!
Gorgeous. I love your makeup, I LOVE your bangs. Cute top too. 10/10. Have a great day 😁
You are super cute! First off, I instantly noticed your pretty eyes and your eyelashes, totally adorable. You have great bone structure and your skin looks amazing, and even your hair looks great. Keep doing whatever it is you're doing, because you're rockin' it, girl.
You have a real talent for makeup! That's so awesome and artistic, and your bangs are so lovely :)
Hi there! Sorry, your post got flagged by our automod. I have approved it now, but feel free to repost for more exposure!
You have such nice eyes, I could look at them all day, everyone deserves to feel confident in themselves and I’m sure you can find it if you believe in yourself!
Will do (:
Hi there! Sorry, your post got flagged by our automod. I have approved it now, but feel free to repost for more exposure!
Woah I'm sorry to hear about your surgery but I hope you make a quick and easy recovery! It's like 2am for me so my overtired brain is noticing the most spazz details but you have gorgeous nail beds and it looks like you do a really nice job of maintaining them! Self-care is always super important so make sure that you specifically take some time out of your days to pamper yourself and de-stress especially since you're likely on edge from surgery and having to buy new glasses. I'm sending you lots of good vibes and wishing you the best! Hope you feel well soon! 😊
Hope you’re recovering well a few hours on, and you’ve been able too get some decent rest.
Okay, a bit of a rough spot, but nothing you can't handle. In fact, you come across as the kind of guy who takes care of business. If you were in my friend group and I needed a straight answer, or help moving my sofa, or a hint to level up, or a ride to the airport, or help painting the living room, or just someone to vent to, I know who I'd call.
He wanted a toasting but got compliments instead. Humans are becoming kinder (?)
You have symmetrical ears. Sounds weird but balances out your face and highlights your lovely eyes. 

I second the comment about your nails - men often forget to keep their nails neat and it makes a huge difference! Keep up the good work and this too shall pass.
Proud of you for getting through a surgery! No matter the reason, that's always tough and requires so much strength. Get some rest and take good care of yourself in the coming days/weeks. If your friends are busy, then it's just an opportunity to invest in yourself and things you love and get some needed rest
I think you’re looking for /r/RoastMe. /r/ToastMe is about compliments
The league is a myth. Find your passion, follow it, then the right companion will follow. You're young, and so much is ahead of you. You look like a great friend of mine back at 18. He's a great guy, and I'd like to think you are as well
I see a young man with tons of potential. dont waste it feeling sorry for your self. Work on your weaknesses if you think you need to but don't be surprised if you already have the skills to pay the Bill's.
I also feel like everyone is out of my league. Like I’m just surrounded by beautiful people. My friends, my siblings, random people on the street, they’re all just so much better-looking than me. But it can be kind of liberating in a way. That means there’s nothing stopping you from shooting your shot. If your base expectation is to just take any possible rejection and keep living your life, then there’s absolutely nothing stopping you from pursuing whatever romantic or platonic ventures your heart desires.

Also, maybe look into starting a little self-care/grooming regimen. It doesn’t have to be expensive or time-consuming, just a few things you consistently do in the morning or when you go to bed—a nice facial scrub, a moisturiser, whatever you want. I found that made me feel better and more put-together. Best of luck, mate.
You look like the actor Michael Angarano, which is definitely a compliment haha you’re attractive
What league?!?! We’re all playing the same scary game. You just got to find what your good at and roll with it. You don’t look like a bad looking guy, but you do look sad. I would right a list of all the things you like about yourself, you honestly have to start treating yourself better. Your only 18 a lot can change over time, your still trying to find yourself and that’s okay, just enjoy yourself the best you can.
How are other people out of your league?  You look like a wonderful companion and a genuine joy to be around.  You're no less worthy of others' companionship than they are of yours.
Hey! First of all, love your glasses and the hoodie. Black hoodies over all else. You're a good looking guy, and I'd bet your personality is perfectly fine too!! 

I know rejection can be hella scary and hurtful, but if you don't try you'll never know! I would bet there is someone interested in you and you don't even know it. 

Also, you're only 18. I know I've changed a *ton* since I was 18 and that was only a few years ago. If there's something you genuinely don't like about yourself, don't be afraid to change it! I used to hate my style, so I changed it. And my hair, so I dyed it. I also used to have horrible social anxiety, so I worked on that! If you- not someone else- YOU, have something you dislike about yourself, you can work on it! But don't change for anyone else. I personally don't see anything that I would change, though.(:
I don't know much about your personality, but I bet you're pretty nice. If everyone is out of your league, there's no hope for the rest of us. I don't see any reason for someone not to like you.
You look like the kind hearted TV character that everyone secretly loves and is funny and always is just a warm person to be around!
Looks like you have stubble which is a really good start. Honestly forget about leagues man, the idea takes away so many opportunities some people you'll connect with others you won't. Don't let yourself miss a chance to be happy with someone because you or someone else believe they're in a higher league take a chance it hurts more thinking about what could happen then finding out. The worst that'll happen is he/she says no, it hurts for a bit you probably wonder why then you probably move on if you don't do anything you torture yourself over the potential and possibly miss out on another great person.
You have a really charming smile and (weird, I know) brows! I may not know your personality but I really understand the feeling of "everyone around me is better than me". Most of the people around you are thinking the same thing! And if you want a confidence boost, a hairstyle change-up, an elevated outfit and other self-care usually lifts me up a bit.
Goat Overlord is damned right. It's not about leagues. Tell you what. Ditch that hood, get yourself a sharp trim, and shave. Dress clean, fresh. Don't be afraid of yourself man. I used to feel really bad about myself, the way I look, and I hid from what I could be. One day, I decided I'd start dressing outside what I had done before. I went for some newer fashions, some dressier stuff. Started getting looks. It brought me up a lot. Got myself a trim and started talking to people, and before long, I met the girl I love today. You gotta put yourself out there. It's scary, but stay confident and trust yourself. You'll get where you wanna go. I promise. Good luck man 👍
At least with girls, looks are only your foot in the door. Girls care less about appearances and more about personality. We might notice attractive guys when we're out, but if the personality doesn't work then it doesn't matter. If you have other ways of getting a girl's attention, and a personality that makes her want to stick around, then you'll be okay. Most successful relationship are compatible people listening to each other and living life together. If you can listen to someone and you're capable of compassion and empathy, then you have a good shot of making it in the romance department. If you're hanging out on a subreddit meant to lift other people up, then I think you have a lot of kindness in you or at least a desire to seek out positivity in life.

As a girl, I can really only speak for what I feel/my friends feel so this is based on that. If you're into dudes then I don't really have much insight.

That being said, I actually think you're pretty cute. You have nice lips and pretty eyes.
You miss 100% of the shots that you don't take. I'm sure your personality could win a lot of girls (or guys) over, don't give up if they reject you either, just move on to another person when you feel attracted or feel a connection.
Thank you means alot alot
Cheers mate thank you
Thank you so much deifntly will look into that
Thank you I don't fully see it but I'm glad someone does
Thank you and you defintly hit the nail on the head with the sad bit
Thank you Legit everyone here has been so nice and wholesome
Thank you so much I forgot to mention in my post and will edit but my main insecurity is defibtly my hight
Thank you wish real life was a t.v. show
Got a massive fear of rejection but for real thank you
Thank you that means so much I really want to change my looks
Oh gotcha! Well honestly I wouldn't worry too much about it. IMO, guys care about height more than girls do. Of course there are those girls who only date guys over 6ft or whatever but if someone is really willing to write someone off because of their height, they likely aren't a super quality person anyway...

I've dated a guy the same height as me and it was nbd before and while we were together, and had nothing to do with us breaking up. We were together for two years!
Man me too, but mine would be a tragic comedy lol, but I'd love to have my own theme song and narrator!
So did I and it took me ages to ask people out I'm almost 19 and didn't ask anyone out properly till like 16 or 17. The fear of rejection may always be there but you just got to remember that it's better to have closure.
Thank you so much I needed to hear that the tonight
Make one for yourself live your best life
I'm going to really try and fix my life in that way
No problem!! You seem like a really great guy, I wouldn't stress the "league" thing too much at all.
That's good to hear man wish you luck! Message me if you want to chat about anything. The first few times I asked someone out I needed friendly peer pressure haha.
Thank you so much I see leagues as everyone else then me you
Thank you means so much to have more people to reach out too
You are a beautiful young woman who I hope not only reaches 18 but goes many many decades past it and I’d be happy to wish you a Happy Birthday when the day arrives.  Here if you need a friend to talk to and I’ve toasted you before hope these word make you as happy as the previous did.
Girl your eyebrows are absolutely perfect! And idk if you're wearing contour or just have incredible cheekbones but either way you look beautiful! I hope you have a good birthday and that you see many more
I hope you make it til your 118th (and that you find love, meaning and happiness along the way)!
You are a cute young women. If you need to talk I can listen or talk. I am sure a lot would do the same. Hugs if you need one.
At the risk of using a cliche: It gets better. I strongly recommend that you see a therapist or enter into a partial hospitalization program. In particular I’d look into Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). And if things get really bad, please call the national suicide prevention hotline: 1-800-273-8255

Anyway, I’m sure you are a wonderful person with the whole world ahead of you. You’re certainly not alone in your struggles. Reddit will no doubt come out of the woodwork to tell you you’re amazing (as we should!) But don’t forget to tell yourself the same thing!

You’re amazing! Please take care!
Feeling anxious about your body is normal. I am a 30s dude and in the best shape of my life, and still body shame myself. None of us are perfect, but we chase it until we die. It's not a healthy thing, tbh. You are young, healthy, and pretty. You have a whole life ahead of you, and I pray you make it to 90. Fuck 18. Live long, thrive, and prosper. Everything is what you make it, and you 100% can do this.
You’re a beautiful girl. I know it’s hard to look in the mirror and not like what you see. Know that it is a real phenomenon, seeing yourself differently and in a more negative way than you actually are. I not only hope you make it to 18, I hope you make it to 88 and beyond. Don’t let the unrealistic standards enforced by the media and society make you feel bad about yourself. You’re gorgeous, you’re capable of growing up to enjoy a beautiful long life, you deserve to live a happy and long life, you are loved by many even if it doesn’t feel like it some times. You’re not alone and you’re worth saving! 

please contact crisis line by texting HOME to 741741

❤️
You are perfect exactly how are you looking, you have no reason to hate your body or selfharming
you are a young woman with a great life ahead of you. if you feel you need help dont be afraid to find it.
Went through your post history and I love all the different hair colours and styles! You're obviously going through a lot of pain right now and I've been there, just know that there will always be someone who loves you or cares about you even if you don't feel that love for yourself someone else is. I hope that in time you can begin to love yourself again and enjoy everything life has to offer. If things get to bad please get help you have so much to offer the world and you're so full of potential! You can message me if you want to talk as I'm sure you can many others here.
Your worst critic will always be yourself. Please dm if you wish to vent I would love to listen and maybe help out if I can. You have a friend right here and I hope venting helps over self harm.
Oh, honey you are a sweet beautiful young lady. Please find someone to talk to and help you with your struggles. Our minds are our worst enemies. You have so much life ahead of you but I assure you this chapter will close and a new beautiful one will begin. Hugs and prayers 🌹
Girl, you got this awesome nose that women go to plastic surgery for. I am not even kidding! Can you imagine there is woman out there who feel like they are not good enough, so they go and pay money to have what (it seems to me like) God has given you? I know, that’s crazy right? Who determines what is good about us and what is not? Who says this is beautiful or it is not? You are perfect the way you are and you are awesome the way you are. Since you were born. Because you are alive. Please be brave enough to believe this. Now!
You're lovely. I truly mean that. I know you might not think so or feel like it, and that's ok. We all have times when we feel like that. I know I do. You don't have to be perfect (whatever that means), just be true to who you are. That's real beauty. You're flawed and fabulous just like the rest of us. And you have such gorgeous eyes too.  I'm here if you need a friend or someone to talk to, any time.
Girl you are beautiful and I’d love to be your friend! Keep your head up things will get better trust me! 💕
Very Cute face and nose very big nice eyes perfect eyebrows nice lips damn you are a beauty. I mean that doesnt mean you cant feel hatred towards yourself but looks shouldnt be a issue. Maybe do something for the community or help out at a animal shelter or whatever you feel like. I believe we love ourself more if we feel helpfull towards our community.
you look similar to the swedish lisbeth salander from the films.

hopefully you may be able to switch or continue at least harming in ways that dont leave marks. i always just squeeze my arm really hard or something. i have some marks from stupid times i'd rather forget but theyll always be there now. not many or prominent, im glad for that.

i dont rly celebrate my birthday or any holiday really, but i hope you find something fun to do or some tasty food at least like me.

you look like me, guess thats why im comparing. ppl call me hot and whatnot but i havent found my looks to help me in life.
I'm sorry to hear you think of your body that way. You're quite cute, with an expressive face that speaks to a sensitive heart that feels things deeply and powerfully. That big heart is a wonderful trait that you should treasure about yourself. 

I wish I could tell you how I got out of where you are now, but I'm not really sure, to be honest. All I know is that it looked like an endless darkness going into it, but I did come out the other side, and I'm so glad I kept going. There were definitely times I wouldn't have kept going if kind voices hadn't been there to guide me forward. I hope we can be those kind voices for you. 

Keep going, sweet girl! You will come out on the other side, I assure you, just keep going! You're a humble and selfless person that just wants love and belonging like we all do, and you will find it, I promise, so long as you keep going! The world needs more wonderful people like you, with that big heart of yours, so keep going! You're gonna make it!
What I came to learn going to therapy because of my anxiety and insecurities is that everything that happens in your mind is part of what you, consciously or unconsciously, are telling it to be.

The hate and the sickness we all have is part of how we define ourselves and our story. We are narrators and protagonists or our story. We are, without wanting it, us and our friends. Think about what would you do if you find a friend in your situation, and apply that to yourself.

Learn to be your own friend, and to not hate yourself. I don't hate you, why would you?

I hope this helps.
You know, you are beautiful. Really. You are. Every feature of yours is soft and sweet and looks like it was sculpted to melt hearts. But beyond that, you look like someone who is willing to listen, willing to care, someone people can trust. People like you make the world okay, make the world less scary for everyone. I hope you find your purpose, and I hope things get better for you. I believe in you. You're gonna do a lot of good for the world.
You are young and beautiful. Please don’t self harm. I did in my youth (I’m slightly older than you) and still carry the scars with me today. I know this sounds cliche but, you have your whole life ahead of you. 

I always tell myself - hold on for one more day. Life can be downright brutal, but I’m still here. I’ve wanted to check out countless times, but I’m still here. Please hang on, there are better days on the horizon for you.
You're really pretty. Also, I'm giving you all the support in the world. I wish there was some way to help.
You are a beautiful young girl! There is no reason to hate or hurt yourself. You would look a lot prettier with a smile, though :)
Dude youre fucking gorgeous what are you talking about

Get that self deprication outta here youre obviously too good for that shit
You have so much value. Your memories and experiences right now are hard. But one day you will look back on these days as a stronger woman... and you'll have the wisdom you need to guide someone else through a similar, dark path. You're the brightest light to someone you've yet to meet.
Dude we are in pretty similar situations and while I can't say anything to make it better I can say that I see you in your struggle, I know how it can feel and that I believe in you even though you don't. Be gentle with yourself and it is okay to be really not okay. Stay safe man, you're valuable.
I’m so sorry that you’re in the situation you are, but honey I promise that things will get better. I know everyone says that, but I cannot stress to you enough the truth of the statement.

You may not see it in yourself, but (like all of these comments) I agree with the fact that you are beautiful, and I’m not just saying that because of the context of the sub.

Self-love is a life-long journey that takes time and commitment, there’ll be dips and peaks like with any path to a goal, but you can do it! You deserve to see the wonderful things life has to offer in the future, not just experience the shitty things you’ve been dealt now. You can do it, I promise, I’m here to talk if you need me!
You're hot as fuck. Not sure what you dont like about yourself. 🤷🏻‍♂️
You're a beautiful girl, and there's so much life ahead of you. I had similar thoughts at your age... I'm only 25 now, but so much better. Life gets better if you let it. Also, I'm very jealous of your perfect skin. Mine...... was not.
Your a very beautiful young lady. I know it hard but just know that sometimes we don’t see how beautiful we actually are, inside and out. Please reach out to loved ones or anyone you trust, I know they care about you. Sending love and good thoughts your way ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
There’s a reason why you are here in this world. None of us know why anymore than you do. But you will find out one day. Along the way you will change lives, cause ppl to smile, show an animal the only kindness they’ve known-many things. Some you may never know about. Stay with us. We need you.
Happy Birthday! You're stunning!
I'm so incredibly jealous, I wish I looked like you. Your face is perfect and I love your hair
You look amazing and I love your eyes
Sharp looks ! 😍

Without any sexist/chauvinistic meaning and as it has been mentioned: You are a beautiful young woman and as corny as it sounds but you got the whole life just ahead of you. I´ve been badly depressed and honestly at my lowest point of life around 22 and i´ve had same thoughts as you. In the end truth being that those moments when i´ve been deeply down has built my character.. like a lot ! 11 years later i haven´t come up with moments as bad as those 11 years ago, nothing has felt as bad as moments back then and yet again i´m happy that i had that phase. You´re much harder to break down when you´ve gotten out of the "pit".

&#x200B;

I wish nothing but the best for you. You will get through this, i´m sure of it ♡
I hope you make it to 99, I hope your life is as bright and beautiful as you are,  I hope it is full with so much love that you barely can even remember these bad days.... its raining but it won't rain forever... and when that sun finally shines threw and you can fill the warm kiss of the sun on your heart, you will know there will always be better days ahead if you don't give up hope!
No matter what you're thinking about yourself, know that someone is thinking about you, and cares about you and your future. You're right at the cusp of adulthood and have plenty of time to make a mark on the world, and I'm sure that a young lady as lovely as you has a big mark to leave.
whyyyyyyyyyy you're so beautiful
You're so pretty just like that elf lady from Lord of the Ring,  i hope you will live long and happy life just like those elves :).
I self-harmed for five years, but now I've been clean from it for nearly four. It's a long process, but the key is giving yourself grace. You're allowed to feel this way, and your emotions are valid. You're not a mistake, a failure, or a waste of space. You're a loved and valued part of the world, and the world is lucky to have you in it.

And on a lighter note, your eyebrows are gorgeous :)
Here. I dedicate this gold to you to let you know that you are perfect. Reddit cares about you and so do I. Please for the love of God, do not harm yourself in any way. You are a beautiful woman and there is nothing wrong with your body. I need you to promise me that you won't do this anymore and live your life to it's fullest. I too can't stand my body and I refuse to go outside with my friends because of it. I hope you make it past 100. If you need someone to talk with, I'm right here and I have nowhere to be.
Thank you, they do make me just as happy as the previous did ♡
I ran out of contour product the day before actually,  thank you  ♡
Thank you ♡
Thank you, I'll  get back to your offer when needed ♡
Thank you so much ♡
Thank you, this actually  helped a lot ♡
Your welcome
Way to go getting the needed paperwork. Cheers to you and your gf and a wonderful life together!
Congrats! I am going through visa/legality issues too and just yesterday I had the amazing feeling of getting an extension for my visa that I really needed! Cheers to us for sticking through stressful immigration systems. 🍻
Your gf is a lucky lady
Hey man wish you both lots of luck and love in hard times as well as those great opportunitys to celebrate like now. You look like fun but still responcible, good combo.
Congrats 🎈
Hell yeah, my man! Congrats on that! I don't know how you have clear skin with that long hair, but you're doin something right!
So handsome. I'm sure your girlfriend feels lucky to have you and is thrilled you'll be here with her!
Congrats on the start of something amazing! Good luck to you and your girlfriend!
Congrats! Good luck in the UK, also I can’t remember his name but you look a lot like the guy who plays Bucky Barns.
That’s awesome.  Welcome, we are happy to have you!  Enjoy the celebration and the time with your girlfriend!
Don't listen to the guy on RoastMe who said you look like you got kicked out of a Christian Rock band. You look like the cool frontman for the only Christian Rock band I'd bother listening to. Stay strong, believe in yourself, and kick ass. Good luck and welcome home.
Congratulations!
awesome!!!!! congrats
That is amazing! Starting that with my boyfriend now, he's in the UK and I'm in the US. Congrats and any advice?
congratulations my friend. throw a party
Congratulations!!
Ferocious and handsome
Good job! Getting those paper is a full time job in itself...not the easy task most people think it is.

&#x200B;

Enjoy your new home!! :)
You did an amazing job! Keep working! Head up stranger!
you have awesome hair and i'm so glad for you! good luck with everything :)
That is amazing!!!
Would sending virtual confetti & the song “Celebration” to you and your girlfriend be acceptable???


This is awesome!! 

I don’t know if the first two things are acceptable but just know that this Internet Stranger is celebrating with both of you in spirit!! Congratulations!! 

P.S. I don’t know what the process is from here with the paperwork but wishing you both the best & a celebratory evening.
You have a very kind face. Are you in the US? Welcome if you are!
That's great!
Best of wishes on your life in a new place!
I know this probably sounds weird, but as a chronic nail biter I’m here to say you have some very healthy nails, and I’m jelly. Congrats to you and your girlfriend!
Congrats! Was reading through the comments and wondering why everyone was being so nice. Realized it wasn’t r/roastme!
Dope hair, as with most long haired men. 

And a bit more on the odd side of toasts: I really like your fingernails. They look well maintained and are a nice length. Very aesthetically pleasing
Fuckin love the hair dude
Congratulations!! My now-husband and I went through the same thing a few years ago. It can be so frustrating, but both of you endured the process together because of your love.

You are a lovely person inside and out, and you and your gf are very lucky to have each other!
Congratulations! I hope you guys are happy together !
Dude, I spent two years long distance with my now wife before I got my visa and could move to the US to marry her. The feeling is just euphoric, isn’t it?

You’re one of the fortunate ones, and especially so because you have someone wonderful to be with. Cheers to your joy!
Oh bruh I almost roasted you until I realized what sub I was on lol but anyways congratulations to you for getting your necessary paperwork and to your girlfriend who gets to keep you with her . Best of luck to the two of you mate ! Cheers 🍻
You look like a viking!
You have such a lovely complexion! Congratulations on the paperwork!
you could grow a nice goatee if you wanted.
🍻
That’s awesome! Hope many, many years of happiness are ahead of you.
That's absolutely amazing!!! Congratulations!
Congratulations!!! A new adventure begins. :)
Congratulations! Must be a massive relief! Best of luck for the future!
Congratulations! I hope you have a long and happy life together here.
Congrats op! Also, you have got great hair
Dude yay! I hope your gf and you won’t face anymore troubles like this. Also, love your eyes they’re beautiful.
Congratulations! I hope you and your girlfriend celebrate in an amazing way.
Hell yeah! Congrats!
Congratulations to you and your girlfriend! May I ask what country you are originally from?
Patent cute cat videos
Nice! I wish you and your girlfriend the best, and I bet you guys will be good! 😁
You ever see a picture of Kurt Cobain when he was younger? Before Courtney, before fame, before he just kinda drained out? When he was happy, surrounded by friends, and driven in life?  


You look like him from that time frame.
Without having any glance at your girlfriend, I'll still say you have better hair :)
Good shit dude!!  Kick off your shoes and stay a while
As an ex-pat, I know first-hand how stressful that process is. Kudos OP!
aaaa congrats on getting the papers! I'm sure your gf is very lucky to have you in her life!
I wish the two of you the best of luck and many happy years!
cheers!
Congrats! I’ve had to get visa documentation before and the stress and uncertainty can be super taxing on a person. 

I hope you and your girlfriend take some time to celebrate and enjoy the moment together!

It's fantastic you took the steps to be with your love. That takes balls. You're a good looking cat. Just stop smiling at the camera like you just got caught shoplifting lube.
Where ya from? If I had to guess I’d say somewhere around either Russia or Australia. (I’m not good at understanding regional topography)
You have amazing eyes! Not just the physical eyes but your gaze is so deep. Captivated me right away!
Oh, and congrats!
Why don't you look happier?

Why are your pupils so big
Thanks this means a lot to me!
Cheers! 🍻
Thanks that's really kind of you :))
Thanks
Thanks for the congratulations and I have no idea either xD
Yes she does and I am very happy to have and be with her to!
Thank you 🍻
Thank you! 🍻
Sebastian Stan.  And I agree!
Thank you!
Well my only advice would be if you really want to be with him then do anything you can to make it happen it will be worth it in the end I tend to live by "nothing is impossible if you really want it"
Yes it is!
UK
Thanks
Just need a longer beard and then I'll be one lol
Sweden and thanks!
I'm the girlfriend and he moved to the uk :)
I'm European but I moved to the UK
I have never been able to smile properly while my photo is being taken. But I'm a happy person in general!
Haha, if that’s what you’re in to
You’re welcome! ☺️
[removed]
UK's not looking great either! Congrats to both of you though, hoping everything goes through and you get to hang around. I'm up in Manchester
Great hair, great five o'clock shadow, good looking dude. I could tell you're the kind of guy who has a big heart.
Dysmorphia sucks but you're aware. You look fine, good even, especially your hair and stub fits you well. Have a nice day or evening or whatever the time is there! =)
Hey man dont know shit about dysmorphia but you look great hope it gets better and cheers to you have a great day.
You look so damn kind. Your eyes honestly tell me a story of a person who’s kind to everyone but themselves. I’ll raise a glass to you my good looking internet friend 🥂. Have a wonderful day, I’m sure you deserve it.
Tough times never last, but tough people do. *~Dr. Robert Schuller*
I'm pretty jealous that you grow full, thick facial hair. I'm 25 and there are still gaps. And love the glasses
You look great!  


Amazing eyes, they give you a very smart and intense look!
First of all, you look great. Genuinely someone I'd be happy to be. Good hair, nice eyes, strong chin. Great set of glasses too, good choice. You look like rock and roll with a jazz streak. Stay strong and stay positive. You got a lot going for you.
Just from looking at the photo, I feel like you have a warm and gentle heart. Your eyes express pain and suffering but there's still resilience shining in you. I'm so sorry you're going through this 💔 It's truly a tough battle and not something anyone deserves. How was your day by the way?
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you, dysmorphia is where you can basically just think only negatively about your body aesthetically so for me it's fat and my hair and dark circles
Awwwww you're sweet, thanks a lot
You arent fat you hair is great and im not sure sure about the third one you mean dark cycle below the eyes? Cause i cant spot them on this picture, maybe the glasses advert the eye. Anyway you looking good man go out there meet more people you will notice no one will think you are ugly.
You’re as fresh as a button! I don’t think I look like that after 8 hours of sleep. Good luck for college, I know you’re going to rock it!
You’re a good looking guy and I wish you all the best at college. I’m sure you’ll do great and I really hope you enjoy it
u look amazing despite not having slept all night, like damn
Your eyes are stunning!
You have a bright future ahead. I just know you're going to do great on college and in life. You're a likeable person, people can tell just by looking at you.
You look great! I’m excited for you to start college, it can be incredibly scary at first but something tells me you’re ready and can handle whatever the world throws at you. Wish you all the best.
You still have your hairline! That's great! I know others at 18 that didn't... Also, dig the clean cut look
You look like wonderful man and you're about to enter what many people consider an incredible period in their lives.  Not only are you going to prepare for your future career, but you're going to learn about the world and yourself in the process.
Fresh as hell, looking good man. Get yourself a nice fade on those sides and you'll be unstoppable. Trust me. College is yours. Good luck 👍
Good luck in college. Hope you get straight A's and make all the friends in the world. But even if you don't, you're still a nice human being who deserves love.
You're going to do great in college. Just do your best in your first semester and you're already doing better than others (seriously there are plenty of people who go straight to partying.) If you get a few C's, don't sweat it, you have time to make up for that. Absorb as much as you can, try to acclimate, and make a friend or two if at all possible. You got this! <3
Fellow HS senior here! College is really scary and if anyone tells you they're not worried, they're lying. It brings me some comfort knowing that everyone else is feeling the same way I am. I'm sure it'll get much easier as we adjust to the new environment, though this isn't going to happen overnight. You look great, and nice hairstyle by the way! 😁💚
Thank you!! Really looking forward to it.
I really hope so too! Thank you!
Thank you!! Had to stay up all night because my favorite team played at 5AM and I knew I wasn’t gonna wake up, decided to not sleep instead.
Need this, thank you!! <3
You only fail if you stop other than that it is speed bumps. Don’t give up and push through just because you had some obstacles doesn’t mean you can’t finish the race. You got it 💪🏻
I failed my drivers 3 times before I got it! These things happen. I know it all feels like a lot at the moment but I know you’re going to be fine - better than fine even! You’re going to be great! When it all feels like too much just stop breath in deeply and remind yourself how much you’ve achieved so far in life. Rooting for you friend!
Im a huge worrier and i do this same thing, i get way ahead of myself thinking about all the things I think i cant handle. I read somewhere that worrying is like praying for things you dont want, and when you worry, you suffer twice. I feel its very true because they more worked up you get yourself in believing you cant do something, the more real it starts to feel and it can become a self fufilling prophecy. 

Whenever i start to get worried about the future and i can feel the anxiety growing and my thoughts spiraling, i try to remember that i can solve all my problems in one day, and sometimes all you can do is put one foot in front of the other, and just take the next smallest step. I know it sounds dorky but i like to think of really simple mantras, just like “i can and i will” or “i can handle this”. 

Hang in there, you got this!
You can do this. Life is 10% what happens to us and 90% how we react. Keep studying. You're a smart person with a great future. Stay strong.
I don't think I know anyone who hasn't failed either the theoretical or practical drivers test **at least** once, most several times. Failing a drivers test doesn't make anyone stupid or bad or anything, the tests are made to be kinda hard to make sure we take driving seriously. Good luck, and if you fail again: ¯\ _ (ツ)_ /¯
In the long scheme of things, those issues won't matter. Whenever something starts to stress me out, I think... will this matter in 5 years? Usually, the answer is no. And I like the hair. I've never dyed mine, but the color is great
Hey, keep your chin up Lou. You got this. Exams aren't the end of the world. Do your best, and love the rest. Life throws us challenges sometimes, but they aren't what defines us. It's our ability to overcome them and stay true to our passion that makes us who we are. Try looking at jobs that you wouldn't normally consider. Believe in yourself, test yourself, and you'll find your way. 😁 Good luck.
I'm wishing you luck at all of those. Also, I'm really digging the blue hair
I see a strength in you. Hell, you’re braver than I for just putting your face in this community. All these things that are drilled into us as being important... the really important things don’t need that. We just know.
Extension of the title: I just feel so stressed right now.. I'm sorry if this isn't toast worthy but I had a breakdown today and an almost break down yesterday.. And I thought I could maybe need some kind words..
Thank you ❤️
Thank you so much.. this really helped ❤️
Thank you very much ❤️
I will try, thank you..
Thanks.. but its so much money per test.. almost 100$ (93€)
Thank you
It takes a lot more strength to continue and that’s something you should be proud of that you didn’t let it discourage you and most people would have just quit or given up but your persistent and that’s a valuable trait
Consider taking "try" out of your vocabulary. Trying gives us an excuse to fail. Instead maybe say "I will!" I support you 100%.
You're right.. I won't quit now
Wow, I never really thought about it that way, you're right! I will. I will stray strong
Exactly! Whenever someone says "I'll try to make it to the party" (or something similar) I guarantee you they ain't coming. Go get em OP!

Edit : my dad was the smartest man I knew. He was a renowned doctor in his field and even came up with certain surgical procedures. Never seen anything like it, and guess what? He failed his drivers test too!
❤️
you have courage to go into those lands
You’re beautiful! Your glasses are so good for your aesthetic and suit your face really well. You also have far more courage than me to go into roast me
I like your face
I don’t see anything to roast at all. I love your style and those glasses really compliment your attractiveness
i love the shape of your eyes, they’re perfect. you have the courage to express yourself through your style and fashion and that’s really cool when so many of us are under pressure to confirm. continue being you (:
I looked through your roast me post, and damn they didn't pull any punches. The fact that you still had the humility to leave it up on your profile and seeing your comments as you took each hit on the chin honestly makes me thin you're a lot stronger and more secure than you let on

I'm too young to post over there but even if I was I'm too much of a pussy to post there anyways, so kudos to you for being able to take multiple jokes on the chin. You should be  walking with your head held high
Cute jacket, cute hat, cut glasses, cute lipstick, cute face!! I love it! We’d be friends for sure in real life. Forget Roast Me, you’re a number one cutie!
You’re super duper cute! I love your lipstick choice it’s a great color on you.. I also think your glasses are really flattering! You’ve got more courage than I do to even try to post on roast me! I hope you have a great day! :)
No
You look great! You are right to post on roast me couse no one would believe you would need encouragement when you are that beautifull.
You're a creative human and very pretty. Smile and stay out of roast me. It's fun to comment in jest but they can take it too far some of them. They ate me alive. You're safe here. We're rooting for you!
The fact that you came from r/roastme makes you seem brave. Guess what's better? You're emotionally stable, being able to ask a similar group of people for help!
I like your style and you are very brave to expose for roasting
 you ever wonder if like, somewhere out there in space, there's another  planet exactly like ours, and like, another Reddit with people  in it exactly like us? Except they're like tacos, like, like taco  people? 

 Sexy, sexy tacos. And you would be the sexiest taco of them all!
You're a wonderful woman and an independent thinker who marches to the beat of your own drum.  I feel like when someone asks you your opinion on a topic, you offer a unique perspective that most people probably would not even consider.  Your companionship and your mind are truly invaluable gifts that couldn't be purchased with all of the money in the world.
Cute fashion sense, good taste in glasses, love your hair, adorable nose, warm and friendly eyes. You look like you'd be so much fun to hang out with.

Edit: Just checked the Roast Me post. So you're a creative type then? Confirmed, you definitely seem like you'd be fun to hang with.
Only r/RoastMe could possibly say a face that cute was anything but perfect just the way it is. You've got fashion, you've got looks, and you've got hope. Stay tough. You're doing great.
Seeking out insults is a form of self harm. You deserve much better than that. Please, take care of yourself, and surround yourself with people who support you. Also, I think you're really cute.
This may sound like an odd compliment, but your chin is absolutely adorable! (I focus on things that most people don’t!)
You are brave to post your picture in both places, the internet can be very unfriendly. I think you look like a fun person to hang out with, I'd totally be your friend. You're also adorable to boot. :)
Why would you go to r/roastme if you have minimal self-esteem?
actl love the vibes you're giving out no lie
You're cute. You kinda remind me of Nancy Wheeler from Stranger Things.
Curiosity killed the cat
Thank you my family hates my glasses and berates me on them constantly
I like you
Someone likes my style yay! I live in a conservative area where it's frowned upon
I'm super shy and socially anxious, so I express myself and my personality through my clothes. Thank you for your kind words
I love this comment so much, thanks a lot
Omg let's be friends yay
It's a Physician's Formula lipstick! I love it! Thank you so much, you have an awesome day ❤️
Yes
You should see what they had to say on roast me, I was burnt to a crisp
I'm rooting for you as well you're great
Emotionally stable hahaha the antidepressants are helping
You're great thank you
I love everything about this.
And tacos.
A lot of people say that I do! Thanks for saying that!
Thanks a lot! I guess you'd say I'm the creative type. I work at a theatre, I draw and paint on my free time (might start posting in art subreddits once I gain some confidence) and I love styling myself the way I do. Love this comment, thanks again
You are also doing great, stay cool
I take care of myself the best I can, I was mostly just intrigued what people would say I guess? I was made fun of growing up by those around me but wanted to know what the internet would say I guess
Thank you!
Thank you!!!!
Curiosity mostly
Thanks a lot!
Thank you! I never watched Stranger Things, is it worth the watch?
Don't think that way, grrr
You look amazing in them! Don’t listen to any negativity people give you <3
Plus those glasses on you 👌🏻
👭
Ok

U cute!
I just read it up and sure they try but cant really find anything so they complain about character wich isnt visible. I think thats a compliment in itself. Brave girl proud of you.
Here's a better representation of what people think. And I'm sorry that you got made fun of. I did too. It really sucks. Just know that that's their problem. You are awesome.
Have a wonderful day!
That’s like going to the liquor store when you have liver issues
Yes, definitely! It's a great show. You should watch it! It's basically The Goonies and Ghostbusters combined with a horror. I'm sure you'll dig it.
I'll try my best!
So are you my guy, have a good day
You too
You smile alot keep it up!  Stay happy man! IF you feel down remember the good times.
That smile! I adore your smile. I love the ones that light up your whole face and make me want to smile back at you. So here I am at work smiling back at your picture.
They’re right, that is one contagious smile. Looking good my man.
Love that smile, especially since it shows off your great teeth. You’ve got really good facial hair too. Keep hanging on in there!
Hang in there! You’re strong enough to go through a full year i’m sure you can take it further!
Your smile is nice and genuine.
What a great smile
That smile-beard combo looks really good my man, keep it up!!
you have an amazing smile and great skin, you’ll make it through to the otherside of discomfort and get the happiness you seek. just keep going
Ah man! Your friendly face makes me feel like everything is going to be ok. I’m sorry the year has been a struggle for you but you’re incredibly strong to keep it up with that smile on your face. Keep at it my friend! It’s up from here!
Wow, that's smile of the day for me mate! When I saw your photo I immediately smiled myself :D 

Anyone who can flash a smile like that, can get through the rest of the year with hope and positivity. I wish you both :)
You probably brightened someone’s day without even realizing it.
Your smile makes me happy :)

Whatever it is you're going through, I'm rooting for you to make it through it, I know you can do it!
This might be a weird compliment but you look so well-groomed?? You don't have a single hair out of place, your eyebrows look great, your skin is glowing and has the kind of dewy, just-moisturized look that's so popular, you have smooth lips and *really* nice, straight, clean teeth. 

You look like the kind of guy who knows what he's worth and takes care of himself, but isn't an asshole because he also takes care of the people around him. It's something about your eyes, they seem very kind and knowing, but also humble. 

You might be struggling so far this year, but I feel like you have good things ahead of you. I'm sure you're inspiring plenty of young men to take better care of themselves so I salute you for that (and thank you on behalf of their future romantic partners.)
Dang, bro. You have some GREAT teeth and the hairline is still solid
Amazing smile, perfectly groomed, but it's more than that. You just have such a pleasant face,you are wonderful to look at, I just want to give you a momma bear hug!
My man! 

&#x200B;

You look like such a cool dude...wanna hit the bars or play a game or whatever?

&#x200B;

You 100% legit look like an awesome hang-out buddy.
you would make a perfect model for an advert  (any product). with that amazing smile I'd buy  it!
Great smile, kind eyes, and sharp hair. You're set, my friend. Stay strong and keep moving forward.
You have the kind of energy that can cheer up everyone around you. Your smile makes other people smile.
Plenty of others have said it but you've got a killer smile bro. I hope the rest of the year gives you plenty of reason to share it with those around you.
This was so nice!  Thank you so much!!
Breakups are the worst, dude, so don't feel bad about feeling bad. Give yourself some time, you'll get through this.
Hey man, we grow with each relationship and usually they have to end to make us the human worthy of the one. Ofcourse now its a downer but you will grow with it for sure. ANd hey you look pretty good and fit you will have no trouble to find someone when you are ready.
it will get a lot worse before it gets better, but in time you'll see you can and deserve to love again!
you are very good looking!! 

See some friends, the world is full of possibilities!
You have stunning eyes! Cheer up! Something good is coming your way! ☀️
Sorry about the heartbreak, one of the worst feelings. You’re going to be ok and you’ll look back and be so grateful for the way things turn out. Plus you’re very handsome and I’m sure there are tons of people hoping to be your next date 🤗
   
Your eyes are magnificent. the world is full of possibilities for you
Really? I’ll take you in the blink of an eye. 😳 We might be a good match, as I look like the Britney of the 2000s, just a handful of years older 😇.
Jealous of your jawline and your tan. I just burn now...
It's your ex's loss. Seriously. Have you looked in the mirror? You won the genetic lottery.
I’m so sorry to hear about your relationship ending. You’re a wonderful looking dude with great potential WHEN YOURE READY. no rush at all. 🥂 here’s a toast to you, an attractive lifeguard who will swim against the current to calmer and clearer waters.
You look nice, I like your eyes. You'll have no trouble meeting someone.
Yikes. I'm sorry man. Breakups suck ass and it takes some time to recover. I don't really know how to help you but thank you for reaching out to this sub 💚
Cheer up. Go for a jog.
I’m a lifeguard so it’s really my job
You’re here. You’re fighting. You’re surviving. And that’s enough! Keep it up! Do something nice for yourself today!
You have pretty eyes, and such a cute nose!
I love your glasses! I hope your day gets better! Sending all the good vibes your way!
If you faked your smile here im done couse it looks honest to me. You should be happy no reason not to be. You might not play everyones game all the time but no one does.
Hey, you don't know me.. you don't have to believe me when I say "it will get better".. But i know it will.  You seem like such a sweet person.. And beautiful too. Especially your eyes, they look so lovely and kind ❤️ Please keep on fighting, it's worth every bit ✨
You're alive, fighting and it seems like you care to continue doing so. That's so much of the fight.
Your hairstyle is very nice!

And you look like a thriving person, keep on going!

Xoxo
It’s incredibly difficult but all of us here are rooting for you!! You’re beautiful, and your smile is so wonderful!! I hope your days just get better from here on out :)
Oh girl! You’re so cute! Your eyes are gorgeous and your face is so friendly. Sending you lots of love from across the ocean cutie 🌸
You are beautiful girl !!! I'm so happy you are here and proud of you for how far you've already come ❤️
Lovely eyes and cute nose. Your face looks very kind and inviting, I bet you can light up a room with your smile when you walk in. Keep fighting you got this, we’re all rooting for you. ❤️❤️❤️
Hey now. I've had too many friends go through eating disorders.... I'm truly sorry to hear it, and I hope you recover. And I like the glasses!
Aww, look at that smile! It warms my heart :) If this is you disheveled, you must be a real stunner when you're all dressed up. Thanks for sharing your smile with us! I know it can be hard to do when you're depressed, but you gave us one anyway, and it brought a smile to my face too!
Your appearance isn't what makes a difference. Your heart is. You have hope, you have a sense of optimism. Between those two, you can do whatever you want. Be strong, and fight to do good. You've got this. 💪
Hold on. The fact that you are even reaching out tells me that you are not ready to give up. Depression is a beast (I know from experience) but you can’t let it overtake you. 

You are beautiful. Even if you don’t feel like that now, I’m telling you that you are. 

All we have in life are a multitude of “temporary reprieves.” So you take those little somethings that you are getting in this thread and use them!

Let them bolster you up when you’re felling bogged down by life. I know that what I have to offer isn’t much, but I hope it gives you the fight to carry on.
Mental health can be a real bitch sometimes, but girl your beautiful self will annihilate these issues, just you wait and see! You’re stronger than you know!
You can do it! 
I may just be a random stranger, but I truly believe in you :)
And I will join many other people in saying: it does get better, even if it may take some time, it gets better

Also, your skin looks very smooth, and you do have a bright smile! 
You look lovely, and if this is your disheveled state , then that means that once it does get better you’ll only look lovelier
Your smile and your eyes are so beatiful!
You look great, I love your smile! Every single day of your life is a day you have lived through and won. There's nothing you can't do, and you're amazing. I have faith in you and know you're going to be ok. And that disheveled look - kinda cute.
Madam you're a lovely woman and a wonderful friend and companion with immense heart and soul.  Your best friend and your family are very lucky to have you and would undoubtedly be torn to pieces if heaven forbid you were to succumb to your eating disorder.  I'm so sorry for all that you're going through, but if you'd ever like a friend to talk about your troubles with, you can PM me.
I hope you get better soon. Also, You have really pretty eyes.
I'm gonna be honest. Your teeth is not ideal.

That's all. Literally that's everything bad I found on you. You really look great and I bet you are nice, too!
And about the teeth - NO ONE is ideal. Everyone has their weak sides, everyone, and honestly, the world has much more important problems than some teeth. There's nothing to feel bad about!
Your eyes are so pretty! Jealous!

I second this!
Seconded, I came here to say what an adorable nose you have!

It doesn't work like that lmao
I also agree on the nose. It's cute and very boopworthy. I wanna boop that nose.
No problem!!!! ♥️♥️♥️
I’ve never gotten so many comments on my nose (or any) let alone it being boopworthy haha 😂
bisexuals unite! i’m sure there are a lot of people who want you, you just don’t know it! 

also, yeah your hair looks good but so does your face OKAY
Man / Girl no matter what you can pull it off easy nice neutral looks for me, and stay positive and positivity will come back at some point! Good Luck!
Guess you could say you’re all bi yourself

Lmao hope that made you laugh. Nobody you’ve met so far is worthy! You’re really pretty so your looks are not the issue. Good things take time :) have a great day <3
You look AMAZING!!!😍😍😍
You are beautiful! Fuck what other people think and you do you. Don’t sweat the small stuff, keep your chin up.
You have gorgeous hair and a sweet, gentle looking face, I bet you are a really kind person as well. Those people that don't want you sure are missing out!
It’s not that no-one wants you, life just hasn’t found you the right person yet. Focus on loving your beautiful self and love from someone else will come! You’re throughly gorgeous, own it!
I would kill for your lips ugh
So many people coat themselves in makeup nowadays, you are naturally a gem! Keep doing you 👍
Hey, you look like a really nice person, keep that beautiful smile on your face. Also your hair are pretty.
I like your style- jean jackets are classic!

And it can take awhile to find the right person or even a good right-now person. Hang in there!
You have the look in your eyes of a loving soul.
Gorgeous! Hair, face, mouth, eyes, all of it! I’m sorry dating has been rough but you’re going to find the right person and they’re going to be so lucky to have you 💗
You have that excellent fresh look that can turn into wowza with some touch ups. Both are yours to claim. You have great features. Your hair is awesome-maybe a bit of conditioner to bring out its colors? Your peeps are out there. Keep that deep gaze and knowing smile going and the right persons will be swept away. You just haven’t met them yet.
You look like a model and I'm so jealous of that lol. Besides, who needs dating. Work towards your goals in your life and hopefully the right one will come by your side.
Props to being true to yourself! Anyone of any gender would be lucky to have you :)
I think you’re quite beautiful!
Good things come to those who wait... you'll be glad you waited when the right person comes along! I love your style. Your vibe is really cool, I can just tell! Try to stay positive!
You are very beautifu, I really love your eyes!
And try to thing positive maybe you doesn't find that person who are perfect for you
Have you seen your lips?

They're perfect
Today you managed AT LEAST 10 minutes of self care, and that's something to be proud of. Focus on liking yourself, and others will follow
Stay true to you.
One part? Hell no. You have gorgeous eyes. Your hair is great, so go get yourself a badass salon job, some fresh digs, and hit the town. Somebody will be head over heels for you in no time.
You have such beautiful features! Is your hair naturally curly by any chance? From a fellow curly haired bisexual
no lie you actually look great? Like you remind me of those really chiselled statues. Those people don't know what they're missing
Not sure what gender you are, but you’re beautiful and I’d like to meet you either way. I hope you can see yourself like you truly deserve to see yourself .
You are absolutely beautiful and have such a beautiful smile it would leave Mona lisa in envy!
Your hair looks great, your eyes are beautiful and you've got nice lips (I'm a bit jealous, if I'm being honest).  You're always welcome at my place. If you're ever in NC stop by for a cup of tea. 

And I'm sure your hair would've been just fine with only a minute of brushing.
Well there are few,  got grindr recently turns out im in older people type
I knew at least one person wont be sure of my gender, Its always funny and cheers me up! ^^
Just on Photo tho took around 60 of these Just to find one i look good at
They arę naturaly redish but i dont think they are prison sentance worth  : D
Sadly there is only one loving soul :P
Well they could use some conditioner i suppose,  also i cant look deep into eyes cuz i start getting shy as hell
I dont look like a model! Problably... i mean thats first time i hear IT and there were times when i was looking better :P
Not always true to myself depends on time and Day!
Thanks i bet You are too!
That is gay vibe im pretty sure.
Eyes are always pretty i belive!
See them every day pretty used to them. Prefer shorter ones.
Hope you don't get offended by this

But every guy that looks at you will want your lips either on his lips or his dick
Yes it is ^^
The mona lisa thing is so sweet thank you!
Well if i will have a reason to fly there why not ! 
And it would Look good for first 30 minutes they are just curly and are always a mess
I guessed you might go with male here but you could easily pull female off if you wanted to also you could easily empathise the male look even more. I guessed you  wanted it to be this way. hf and stay who you are!
No im telling you! You are beautiful! The hair😍 them eyebrows 🤑 that chin 😉  everything looks so pretty!
Try not to be so hard on yourself,coz all of you is speaking beautiful!🌹❤🌹
Well, I’d definitely want to hang with you. Keep that gorgeous head up
You have great hair. The colors are cool and conditioner brings them out. Why not,eh? I’m shy too. I never ever make eye contact. Scares me. Feels like I’m gut shot. But I think if you were taking in a sunset or wildlife or such, you would have a calm gaze that a person could sit with for hours. You have a deep and soothing look about you.
Trust me you look like one. If I was you, I'd definitely consider modeling or something.
Tomato tomato
It's more pretty when a person is happy
PM me if you ever want curly hair tips!!!!
Absolutely  :)
Was thinking about crossdressing on some anime con a bit to shy tho, Maybe next year!


Edit : also it wasnt a choice my beard just dont grow and is feel good in long hair
Well the head is usually down,  gotta look where you are going or you will fall
Wow i guess we are the same
Maybe someday for now i need to take care of my diet and fitness. Let set my chances as high as o can; P
I know i need to brush them after shower when they are wet and i need to use conditioner is there much more i should know?
Probably in more ways than this. There’s a place for us in this world. If you get a quiet moment, google Desidrata. It got me thru many insecure times.
So I actually don’t own a brush. I have a wide tooth comb I only use in the shower. I stopped using products with sulfates and parabens about a year and a half ago. Shea Moisture is a popular brand but it’s expensive and Cantu works just as well. After you get out of the shower (and you’ve shampooed and conditioned) then you can add product (lots of options. Gel, cream, mousse, etc.) and scrunch your curls and either diffuse them or let them air dry. I also use a scrub tee shirt and scrunch some of the moisture out. I want to be the kind of person that diffuses my hair but I’m lazy so I typically let it air dry. Additionally, I’ve gone from washing my hair every 2 days to once a week. Better for your hair and as a nice bonus it’s easier because curly hair is a lot of maintenance! 

Tl;dr: don’t use a brush or comb outside of the shower, use a tee shirt to scrunch your hair dry, try some curly hair products 

disclaimer: not an expert. just have curly hair
Oh i have other ways i always Think about poetry book im writing and my future doughter (hope, in polish it sounds 10 Times better )
I just feel like brush works better for me, i always leave my hair to dry. Never use t shirts or driers. Also since im a teenager and its hotele as hell i actually wash my hair everyday. Would like to work it out to like once every third day. Would be healthier for them i think.  

Also i dont use t shirts becouse i dont like my curly hair :P
Very deep ppl do poetry. It’s a gift from the universe. Something incredible to do. Writing poetry is like giving an organ or donating blood. It heals a person deep inside. Poetry is magic.
Fair enough! It’s whatever works best for you! It took me a very long time to embrace my curls. Best of luck on your journey!
First things first, try calling a suicide hotline. They really do help. Visually, theres nothing wrong with you. You have a good symmetrical face, and very clear skin, and nice thick hair. If you want, I can give you my personal number or discord and we can chat more. I'm free to be a friend if you need
Hey there, I’m going to keep this one a bit short as sometimes that can make a more lasting impression.

You **deserve** a well lived, long life. Whatever is making you feel this way, maybe be multiple things, leave it behind. You have the power to change your situation and start on a happier path.

All the best
In 10 years from now, you will be curled up on the couch with your spouse, listening tl the rain hit the roof and watching your children play. And you will think to yourself "Damn. Im so happy i stuck though the tough times...i made it :) "

Good luck brother, i believe in you
Hey! Have you tried heading over to r/suicidewatch ? Those guys are great. 

Secondly, I‘ve been where you are and it does get better. I know everyone says that and I didn’t believe it, but here I am. Two weeks into counseling and i wanted to die more than ever, but somehow I didn’t. Now I’m 5 months on anti-depressants (4months since they started working) and every day I marvel at something new I’m able to do it able to enjoy. Life does get better and you should experience it too. I know the world is better with you in it!
I tried to kill myself about five years ago. I thought I was helping everybody I loved by disappearing so I couldn’t be a burden. I couldn’t imagine that I had any value to anyone. After my suicide attempt, I was stunned when people told me that they needed me and how I was making a difference. Since then I have gone on to accomplish things I had not thought possible for me. I feel like a different person. I take my medication and I attended therapy, and I ask for help when I need it. I am not a remarkable person. The only thing that changed is that I let people help me and I won’t give up on myself. If you let people help you and you are kind to yourself (even if you don’t initially believe you deserve it), things will get better for you. It takes time to change your mindset, but you can do it. There are people who love you and need you. There will be people who will never be okay again if you die by suicide. People you might not suspect. I am grateful that I didn’t die before I had the chance to get better. You have that chance ahead of you too! Stay determined. Let someone give you a hug. You can do this!
7 days to die is a game on steam. Maybe play that and uhh don't die please. You have so much for ta live bud, don't violate your future
Just send me a message anytime and I’ll try to reply as soon as I can, most of my family is in Sweden so I’m use to that level of time difference haha
I’ve been exactly where you are right now before and trust me, it will get better. I know happiness seems unachievable at the moment but you just have to keep on going. Seeking help, no matter how small it is, is so brave and for that, I’m so proud of you. My advice to you is to find something, anything, that keeps you going. It could be a game or an animal or a person, but finding that thing is the key to making it through. I’ve noticed that a few others have given you suicide hotlines and honestly, they are so helpful. I’ve called them before and the people there are so nice and caring. If you don’t like to call, most countries also have text lines as an alternative. I really recommend doing something like that. Or you could even message me. I’m always here to talk. Please keep on going. I know it’s painful now, but it will get better for you :)
People  often think, If I fail, I will lose something very important - like  getting into a good college, working at a great company, getting a  promotion at work, making lots of money and so on. But learning from our  mistakes is one of the greatest tools for learning; it gives us  information on what we need to do differently to succeed in life.

I  went through a period of my life where I’d tell myself every day that I  hated myself. It got to a point where I’d be in a conversation with my  friends or family and my mind would be running and running,” I’d be  thinking about all the stupid things I’ve said in my life, or all the  time I have wasted and it would just race and race. I had no motivation  to do anything. I would cry and cry (sometimes just internally). I would  be angry at the smallest things, I would scream driving in my car or  yell at our innocent little dog. Just having to change and put on  clothes, I said, ‘I can’t do this, I can’t.

There’s a quote I read that explains it pretty well:

**‘I forget to love myself most days. But I keep trying. I keep trying. And that alone is a victory.’**

If you’ve never struggled with the art of loving yourself, you may not get it, but for others, it’s real.

***T*****rying** to love *YOU*  is a victory in itself, so I don’t give up. I am needed and my life  matters - even when it doesn’t feel like it. I look for the good things  and cling to them. Now, for me, it is a daily decision to make it (my  life) work. To seek out the parts of my day, week, month or year that  brings me a sense of peace.   Everyday is another hash mark on a  successful "*LIFE"* scoreboard. The scoreboard that means I have survived another day. I am here for my family and friends. **I am here.  I am here.**
I know that spot. It's hard. Really, really hard. You can pull out of it. I believe in you
You seem like a nice person and I am sorry that you have to go through this but if you feel like you have no reason at all why don't you create one? Set a reasonable goal then a big one, try to accomplish them, there's so much to see on this world, so many nice people to meet and talk, think about all the dishes you'll never get to taste or all the places you'll never get to see if you give up now. I know it's hard, I know you think there's nothing else that will make you want to continue living but there is! It's you. You're worth the effort, you're worth the try. Don't try to please others, don't act like someone you're not, get out there and get some professional help. Let people who are trained to help do their job, it's okay to be vulnerable, it's okay to take some time for yourself and it sure is okay to ask for help. Coming to us was a good start now take a second step and please see a professional, try it for yourself, for all the people you never met but would like to meet, for us.
You need to let the people around you In, on this bro. Causing others more pain happens when we don't speak up. You're already so Incredibly brave, for posting this! Follow through, by coming out the other side stronger. Think how many people you can save, once you have saved yourself? Millions feel the same way as you do, right now. You're never alone. Going to counselling already makes you a success; Owning you problems and dealing with them. It ALWAYS gets worse before It gets better, when counselling/therapy begins. The sessions WILL get more positive, In time. Keep your chin up, legend In the making!! X
Please don’t do that. This too shall pass. Things won’t always feel this hopeless. Trust me. I’ve been there
I'm toasting you for posting this. THANK GOODNESS you are reaching out, crying out for help. That is your soul telling you that there IS something to live for. It is hard to see now, I can only imagine the pain you are feeling, but the picture I see in front of me is a bright young, beautiful human who DESERVES to be on this Earth. The world is a better place with you in it.
First off, I’m proud of you for seeking help. It’s a great act of courage to put yourself out there when your mental health makes you feel like there’s no reason to keep going. Secondly, something that helped me a lot when I was in your same position was reading a post that said “any reason to live is good reason to live”. Literally anything that makes you feel good, or happy, or content, or something that you enjoy- live for that. Cheesy movies? That’s a good reason. Eating your favorite food? That’s a good reason too. Finding small things to hold on to can keep you anchored, as well as serving as a respite from the way you feel. 
I encourage you to keep reaching out. If you want to talk, I’m always here to listen. Suicide and crisis hotlines are a great resource, but if you don’t like talking, i suggest the text based crisis service ImAlive. They’ve helped me a lot too. 
You have a valuable place in the world, and you deserve to feel okay, if not happy. We’ll all be rooting for you.
You are not alone. Things will get better. Please hold on.
Hey so I read a bit through your post history and saw that you had a girlfriend? Are you still together? Maybe you could try and open up to her a bit more. I'm sure she'd want you to. I know the world can seem unbearable at times, but you are only 16. I know you don't need to be reminded of it but you are so young!! SO young!! You have your whole entire life ahead of you! You still need to grow up, become a man, a husband, a father, even a grandfather! You can't give up now when there's still the rest of your life to build! When you feel so down you think you can't continue, give yourself 10 years. Because in 10 years time, whatever shitty thing is happening in your life right now won't matter! It will become insignificant, or time will make it less painful. So give yourself 10 years. And talk to people! Talk about your feelings, your emotions, what's bothering you...because it helps to open up. Doesn't matter to who, just keep reaching out to people and you'll find that it always helps. So don't give up okay? Keep on living!
I had my own set date 4 years ago. I had just turned 18, here I am at 22 writing to you after I got help. I want you to know you have so much to live for, I thought that I didn't either. I was basically failing high school but now I've graduated from my trade with a certificate in medical assistance, I'm helping people, I'm in love with life. All of us are begging you to please help yourself get the love, help and support you need. You need to heal in order to go on, and then you can fall in love with living again. We want you to reach out. Your life is precious. You are precious. ❤
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicide_crisis_lines

I don’t know what country you’re in, but here’s a link to suicide crisis resources by country. In the US you can text the word “connect” to 741741 to use the crisis text line.  I just needed to add this info since I didn’t include it in my original response.
You have so much more to offer than what your mind is telling you.   The overwhelming feeling will pass.  I truly believe you are capable of pushing through this.   Posting this shows the strength inside you.  Take the next step get some help.  You are not alone in the way you feel and you don't have to go through this alone.
You matter! feel free to PM me to chat about anything and everything you want to. I know how dark and hopeless things can seem sometimes but please listen to everyone in this thread. You took the first step, asking for help and acknowledging your feelings. One day at a time my friend, things will get better!
Taking your life won’t take away the pain but pass it onto someone else. The window screen of a car is bigger than the rear view mirror because what’s in front of you is more important than what’s behind you. Just remember even the brightest stars need darkness to shine. God bless Brother
Feel free to pm me if you want to vent, you don’t know me but I’m a very good listener and I’m a nurse. Emotions are really tricky, I had issues that I had to deal with from early in my life and a counselor helped a lot but time was the biggest factor in healing. No one could really fix how I felt except me. Coming to terms with issues and recognizing them takes time so don’t expect results anytime soon but they will come. School is another thing. When I first attended a university I dropped out after not even a year and worked for a year and then went back to school for something else. Was it the right thing to do? Who knows, I’m where I’m at today because of that decision so all that matters is where I’m at now. Changes can be sudden and then they can be really slow. The best thing you can do is focus on each of the little changes and see those as progress, before you know it you will be further ahead than you realized 😁
hey man you are young and you feel its justified to give up, but reconsider that time will pass faster after every day and we dont have much time anyway. Do ANything, something that matters. Try help others or yourself. You can do it!
I feel you. You are not alone here. The most important thing is to get through one day, everyday. Keep holding on my friend.
Friend you can continue living a full long beautiful life. This is a dark time for you but I and others can assure you that it will get better. We promise it will.
You look like you have plenty to offer to yourself and those around you. Think you can change the world for the better. I think you can turn it all around and use this tough time to help others who are in your shoes. You can do this! Don’t let this be the end, you have a lot to offer!
I was in the same exact situation as you bro, up until 4 months ago....Out of nowhere I met the girl of my dreams, started to feel happier, feel like I have a purpose....You wont ever know when it's going to happen but PLEASE believe me in the fact that it WILL happen ok?...You will be SO SO happy that you were strong enough to make it. You look tough as shit my guy, stick it out for all of us who have been were you are....Life is fucking weird but it always works out. Had house fires where I lost everything physical, had heart breaks that robbed me of everything mental but life will always balance it out in time. You just have to wait...be strong and wait. Love you bro!
First of all:love your hair and i bet you have a awesome smile

I could give you 100 reasons to live,not kidding 100 REASONS,but i want first to say,tri talking to a suicide hotline they really help 

My best friend killed herself and i still cry everyday so much and i feel so sad all time

Is painful to know what you are going trough,but please we will miss you and is not worth it

We love you okay?<3 try a suicide hotline,they will help
Dude you got this. When people say it gets better, it really does. It goes up and down, and has good/bad on the way, but over all it DOES get better.

Worst years of my life were teens through to early 30s - now mid 40s and life is fucking awesome.  


hang in there for me mate!
Hey, you're awesome. I get your whole face just lights right up when you smile.


That said, every day you wake up and climb out of bed is already a victory. You can do this.
[deleted]
This too shall pass. If you need a friend I’m here!
You have to allow time for things to get better and they will. You don't know the potential for happiness that you actually have because you haven't given yourself the chance. If you have only been in counseling for 2 weeks give it a couple more weeks before you do anything too drastic. You got this! I believe in you.
I know how hard it is. But I promise you it can get better. You have the potential to make other people's lives better. Please rethink.
I know that this world can get hard and dark, but you got this! You don't have to be okay, you don't have to be strong, and it's okay to feel like shit-- as long as you rise again. I've been there before, so many people have... just remember that you are not alone!
Actually, You're emotionally stable, being able to ask the internet for help!

The internet is a place full of depression and dark humor. Personally, I like it, because my emotions are complex too.


Maybe you should take a break, talk to your family, then maybe change your mind?
I like your haircut, it looks great on you.
Hang in there, it’d be a real shame
You matter & I promise that it gets better. You’ve gotta stick around to find out-
you are an incredibly strong person. battling suicidal thoughts takes an incredible amount of courage. my pms are always open. keep fighting, tomorrow needs you ❤️
The fact that you're here sharing this at all means you're brave enough not to suffer in silence. That alone is a reason to toast yourself-not everyone has the courage to admit when they're struggling. 

I glanced at your post history (hope you don't mind), and it looks like you've recently been rejected by a girl. Toast yourself for putting yourself out there in the first place-a lot of kids your age (I'm assuming you're pretty young) don't have the guts to ask out people they have a crush on at all. Please don't lose that willingness to try again in the future: in my experience, people who are up front about their feelings and who are willing to approach people they like are the happiest in relationships later in life, in part because they've learned from rejections. 

You're brave-can you use that bravery to get professional help?
/u/ashmit50042 Hey dude I hope you see this,  I just wanted to let you know that you’ve got a friend in California rooting for you. Also from your comments you seem like a super cool dude, and I noticed you’re active on this sub, leaving toasts for other people that need it :) You also clearly care quite deeply about your family and friends. Very cool stuff my dude, despite the darkness you’re going through.

I don’t have any advice per se, but I wanted to toss you the idea that sharing your problems with a friend is often actually a huge compliment to that person because you are telling them by your actions that you trust and respect them enough to share your deepest shit with them. Whenever a friend has shared difficult issues with me or even broken down crying over something very painful, I have never felt burdened - only a deep LOVE for them, increased closeness to them, and a desire to be there for them in whatever way will help most! If you think back to the times your friends have opened up to you about real shit, I sincerely doubt you thought any less of them for opening up to you and probably if anything the opposite. Believe your friends when they say they care about you - they mean it! And if you give them a chance I’m sure they will prove it :)

Of course for some people this ^^^ is definitely NOT the case, but that is down to one’s friends ... That would suck, but if it turns out your friends are truly uncaring people there’s no time like the present to find that out and replace them with way better ones :D I hope tomorrow is decent for you my dude, please reach out any time 👊🏻
This will get better, it simply has to! I promise, when things are at their worst, somethings got to give, and that means things do change and get better. 
You’re young, and this sense of despair is far more common than anyone realises. You will get through this. And what’s more you’ll be a stronger better person for it.
I don’t know you but I do know that you have a lot to offer the world. Things WILL get better. You can overcome what you’re  going through and I promise things will turn up. Read the comments to your post, there are so many people rooting for you, offering support and wishing the best for you. Whenever you’re feeling down, reach out to your loved ones or even some of your Reddit supporters here :) don’t give up!
Hey friend you have lots and lots and lots of support. Please instead of doing anything message anyone who commented something kind and they’ll help you through. Try to set a therapy date if you can. You can get through this even though it doesn’t feel like that. Lots of people (me included) have felt the same but have found the right treatment to finally feel mentally healthy. Sending lots of love/thoughts/prayers
Please don’t do that, you’re giving out a call for help which means you do want to get better. It may seem like you’ve hit rock bottom but that just means it can only get better from here. You are loved, that’s a reason to live. Think of what a better future you’ll make for yourself because there’s always hope. It’ll be difficult but you are strong enough to overcome this.
Reach out to me anytime my dude. You seem soulful and full of potential. One day, you're gonna be important to even more people than you know. Message me anytime man.
Stay strong dude! We support you!!!❤️
Hello! 
Two semesters ago, i was on the verge of killing myself, i even planned it out and wrote a letter for my friends and family. 
But you know what? i’m so glad that i stuck through and did not proceed, no matter how much you plan it, its never a good plan, ever.
I have received love from not only the good people that surround me, but even from inanimate subjects in my life. i simply find joy in the simplest things now. Don’t give up just yet, there’s a lot you could look forward to!! goodluck on this amazing (but very hard) journey that is life, keep going, you got this.
Go to r/suicidewatch
Please don’t. You are one of a kind, believe it or not. You impact others lives in a unique way. Those memories you made with friends and family members will never have same impact or feeling if done with others. You bring such unique energy into the lives of those you have met. Be that person you wanted to save you. I know how that feels to have the feeling of not wanting to be here anymore. Continue to get help, realize that it’s not going to be easy peachy, and that’s it okay to feel sad. See today as a step to a new you, new life. You are in charge and if you want a fresh new cycle today, you can. You can do it! I believe in you. It makes me really upset that you happened to feel that way, but please don’t give up!
There are so many people here who have said so many things better than I ever could, I just want to send you some love. I have sons your age and your sadness affects me deeply. If I could show you how wonderful your life could be and keep you from this permanent end, I would. Love to you, and I wish for you a long life of health and happiness.
I know you can't see it, but there *is* a light at the end of the tunnel. I have been in the loony bin my fair share of times and depression is something I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. I may get downvoted into oblivion for suggesting it, but does where you live have a psychiatric ward or hospital? Honestly, as much as inpatient treatment sucks, getting admitted the first time saved my life. Since you're suicidal you need to call the suicide hotline or go to a hospital. I am sending all of my love to you. You rock, and you have survived all of your worst days so far, keep surviving. Please! Feel free to PM me. If nothing else I can offer a listening ear. Sending love to you :)
I’m rooting for you to keep going! I can’t imagine how much pain you are feeling, but I promise that if you ask for help and are patient, the pain can be managed and you can be happy to keep living. 

You are a wonderful, special person who is loved.
You look cool.
Don’t do it man, I know everyone says it but you can get to a happier place in your life. My DMs are open if you ever need to talk bro, I’m here.
It will get better
Hey, even if you don’t see it—you make the world a better place. Even if you feel like no one would notice/care if you died, you are NEEDED, you are WANTED, you are LOVED.

I know sometimes life seems like a giant mountain and you’re already exhausted, but all you need to do is put one foot in front of the other. Don’t think about your entire life at once, just take one day at a time.

You have so much to offer the world, and the world has so much to offer you. 

We all love you so much, man.
Listen here my friend, I've been there. I know how it feels. The hours long stares at the ceiling. The empty feeling. Not being able to hold back your tears or just feeling so deeply tired you cannot cry at all. Not being able to see any escape or any chance of it getting somewhat bearable.

But you what? I got better. I got help. I don't think of committing suicide anymore so, PLEASE, don't give up. Not for me or anyone else, for yourself. Talk to someone you trust, seek professional help, write down how you're feeling, anything. Take small steps and slowly pave your road to recovery. If the loser over here did it, so can you. I know you've heard this a lot before, but it does get better at some point and it will be worth it, I also didn't believe that, but it really does. Hope to hear from you 8 days from now :)
I believe in you. I know that you are strong as well. Believe in yourself and you can get through even your darkest days. You are a lot stronger than you think! I know how it feels to feel like you have nothing left, but trust me... you have a million reasons to stay and keep living. Think about everything that makes you happy, and surround yourself with those things. I know it’s easier said than done, but life truly does get better with time, and time does heal all wounds. If you ever need someone to talk to, please message me anytime! I’m always here to listen🌸 sending love and light to you, and I promise that things will get better! I believe in you!
I'm so sorry that you're in this place right now, but please know that a lot of people have been where you are, myself included, and have made it through and it does get better. That might sound like bullshit right now, and it might sound the same way in seven days, but the fact that you're asking for help says some part of you wants to live and the day will come when that's the biggest, loudest part of you.

Also, please call a suicide hotline. I called when I was at that point, and I really wasn't expecting it to change anything but it saved my life and actually made my outlook a little better, enough to keep building on and get well.
You look just like my childhood best friend, and this post has taken me back to good times we had. Just looking at you, one can tell you’re a good dude. The world is a better place with you in it, and I hope you can come to love yourself, the world, and find your right place in it.
Which part of India are you from? I'm from Hyderabad! If you live anywhere close by.. please do hmu and we could go out and grab a drink and talk it out.
Hey if you ever need anyone to talk to let me know, you can always send me a chat or I can give you my discord.
I can't say much about your life, other than it has value. Every good thing you do makes your life worth living. Every person you can help, every charity you can benefit. You can do a lot of good in this world. 

Maybe you do hate your life. Maybe you're unhappy. But you can do the simplest things, and you can make that struggle easier for a thousand people. 

I changed hundreds of windows in an apartment complex by myself. The work was hard, and tiring, and lonely. I got cut, bled, cleaned for hours, and I was fairly miserable. But one day I started to notice that kids were looking out of the windows I was putting in, huge smiles on their faces. I realized it was because they couldn't see out of the old, worthless glass that was there before. It changed their world. Adults, too. People who felt trapped and alone could now look out at the world, and find hope for the future. 

You have a purpose. You have value. You can change lives. And you might just find that in doing so, you'll change your own. You just have to find out what it is you can do. Good luck, my friend. Stay strong.
I lost a friend to suicide a few months ago. Even though it may be hard to see there are people who will miss you. My friend felt alone even though so many people came to his funeral and miss him every day. You are not alone and there are people who love you. Things will get better please give them time
You are young, attractive, look pretty healthy, and life has so many twists and turns. Instead of dying in 7 days, make a life change, a drastic ALIVE one. Something that is scary, but a different kind of scary than you are dealing with now. If it doesn't work out, well, at least you aren't dead. If that doesn't work out you are stuck. 

Maybe sell off what you can and move somewhere new. Go get some job that doesn't have anything to do with what your future is "supposed" to be. Buy a train ticket to a place you can't pronounce and promise yourself to talk to 10 new people. 

And then also get some professional help. You need meds and talk therapy. It can help. May as well give it a try, first, anyhow!
Just know that it gets better.  Today might be bad.  Tomorrow might be worse.  next week will be better than the last two and the week after, better than that.

I speak from experience.  Keep up with the counseling as it does help.  They also have anonymous text lines you can utilize.
You have lots to live for. Just start with the small things you are unhappy with then the big things will come!
Oh!, you look so much like my son! (Handsome and very intelligent!) Please talk to someone about your real feelings, people do care!!!
Just checked this guy's profile just to be sure. You might all call me a sick fuck if I'm wrong, but this guy is karma farming. 

Now onto your case if you really are struggling with everything. Please as mentioned earlier, call a suicide hotline. They're no joke, they help. Do something to clear your mind, start singing, dancing, writing and things such as painting. Find yourself a hobby that you enjoy. Also, feel free to pm me if something if you wanna talk. You're a good looking dude, so don't worry about your looks man.
Hey bud, it's gonna be rough getting through this, but I can promise you that suicide will never end any suffering, especially if you survive the attempt. I'm a suicide survivor, and I can promise that there are better things out there.
Do you want to talk about what's going on that is making you plan this out?
I don't want you to die man, even though I'm an internet stranger, I know some of the feelings and how horrible it can be to lose your will to live.
I'm sending love across the Net.
I’ve been where you are and still struggle a lot .  Do not do it though. 
There’s a study that most survivors of suicide end up regretting jumping or taking the pills as soon as they do it. It’s an impulsive act. 
I’m not saying tor life with get a hundred percent better but you will have up and downs like everyone else. 
Fuck it, live your life to the fullest because it can only go up from here.
hey, pm me if you need someone who will send you memes and distract you from the sufferings of life. that’s how i got through my darkest hours. you’re physically very cute, i especially like your nose and hair. but emotionally you should seriously call a suicide hotline. they’re really helpful. sorry if this is a bit all over the place. just know i’m here for u
Please, don't. Even if it seems like there's nothing, now, there may be something later. I hope you can be happy at some point. I don't know how to help you, but I'm definitely willing to listen.
I don't even need to know you to know that you belong here with us, stick around for a while, if you ever need a friend... you know where we are! I love this page, so a toast to you! Stay strong 🙌
I self-harmed the other day and texted 741741. The person I talked to was really nice. I love you. Get well. ❤
Here are so many really good and positiv answers and I really can't say anything as smart like them, but I wish you all the best in the world! 

Everybody in this world has problems, some more and some less and everyone is just "fighting" through the days, because it's worth it! 

Nobody should die this young my friend. 
I lost my father when I was a little boy and it really really "screwed me up" and I'm depressed on many days but I'm always happy to be alive. 
Your Familie and friends wouldn't be the same after this and always wonder "why and why he didn't speak to us and why couldn't we help him". 

There are so many beautiful places to visit, so many nice peoples to meet and so many things to discover before we die. 

You will have a beautiful life, but you really have to keep going! Every days brings new possibilities! 

I believe in you and I bet very many people do it too!
Please please please, seek some help if you can, and if you can’t, please remember you’re much stronger than you might think you are right now. I’ve had depression my whole life, and thought about suicide more often than not, but every day I wake up I try to value as much as I can. I know it’s a cliché to say it gets better, but clichés are clichés for a reason. Pm if you wanna talk, I would love to get to meet someone as seemingly wonderful as yourself!
Personally, crisis hotlines weren't very helpful for me, given my circumstances but I truly hope they can help for you. Always remember that nobody has ever lived your life and never will, they don't control your emotions. Only you can really help yourself. Feel free to message me, I've did myself out of the worst suicidal pit and have been out for a few months!
Don’t do it, no one wants you gone, things’ll get better and you’ll be able to look back on this, good luck <3
Your good looking for one thing.
My heart goes out to you. 

When I was at my worst, I held on because of the people that (for whatever reason) cared for me. Thinking of those kinds of people/creatures in your life might help, but each person is different. 

There is a book that I've found helpful, it's called "The Reality Slap" by Russ Harris.

The point of the book is to help you get change the things that can change, and accept the things you can't. It's not about being a little ray of sunshine, but having peace regardless of what else is going on.

I hope that you find the determination to keep going, for whatever reason helps you keep moving forward even if it's a baby step a day. Please take strength in knowing that there are many people who have been where you are, so you aren't alone in your pain.
Hey man. Right out the gate, you’ve got some good looking hair. But, I know things are tough right now. But you’ll get through this. Life will get better and you’ll look back on this in the future. Definitely take advantage of the resources other people have shared. 

I wish you the best from the bottom of my heart. I believe in you man.
You're very brave, man. I know it must seem really bleak and scary now, but you've made it this far already. You've pulled through so much, and you're very resilient. Please listen to these people's words of encouragement. You mean a lot to all of us. Please take care, man. We're all here for you.
Please don’t. I’ve been in your shoes. I was in your position about 5 years ago. I hit rock bottom and was ready to give up...and then somehow, life just started to work in my favor. I am now healthy and loving my life and the people in it. Trust me when I say it gets better. Once you hit rock bottom, there’s nowhere else to go but up.
You are loved! You are treasured by your Heavenly Father...please don't cut your life short. The world needs unique YOU!
Bruh, it's stupid to give up now.  Suicide survivors have said that as soon as they jump or anything of the sort they immediately regret it and go on to better lives.  Dont leave living to chance, just skip that and try to realize how astronomically unlikely it is you are alive at all and try to enjoy that for as long as you can
How boring to never know what your life journey was. You may have a lot ahead of you, and you would write it off and throw it away before fruition. Life is a game, play it how you want. I hope things get better for you.
Please please don’t do it. I’ve attempted suicide about 12 times and been hospitalised so many times etc- I’ve also lost people to suicide and to see the looks on their loved ones faces.... just please. Please don’t.
It never seems like it’ll change, but I promise you that things can and will get better. You did the brave and right thing by speaking out, I’m here if you need to talk!
Please don’t die. The world will be worse off without you in it.

Hey thanks man. I've never really had body issues (yay) and I've been going to counseling for the past 2 weeks now. I'll def hit you up when I really need it. Thanks for your offer
Always avoided the hotline even after multiple suicidal episodes until one day I was about to do the deed and figured I’d see what they have to say before I go. I know it’s because they are trained to but they know EXACTLY all the right things to say. The things friends and family won’t know to say to you. Things you’ve been dying to hear whether you knew it or not. Whatever issue you are having they will provide solutions for it as well including giving you links and numbers to call.
[removed]
Damn that put good images in my head!
This can be so true. I was thinking about my past depression at high school/uni yesterday (10+ years), and am so extremely glad that I put through all those years. I am now happy, living together with my superawesome SO, and I left all those dark times behind me. Of couse some periods are rough, but thats ok now. Think about this, you have so much time for it to get better still. Please put through, although it can take time, better times will come for you too I’m sure.
What he says is absolutely 100% true, this may be the tough part but you just got to keep going, you can beat this!
Thank you for staying alive.
Ok thanks. I'll drop a line when I need it the most. Thanks a lot for your help
I had a a long term goal with my life that I was hoping would give me the motivation to power through school after which I would have the time and concentration to work on it. But now I'm just feeling like it's not nearly enough, and an old (potentially life-threatening) medical issue I had a while back is resurfacing, so it almost feels like I'm meant to die young even if I don't off myself.

I might consider texting a suicide service, but I don't see how I can bring myself to open up to a complete stranger if I can't tell my closest and most trusted friends. They all know something's up with me but I can't bring myself to dump my problems on them when they've got their own shit to deal with (and believe me, they're going through some worse shit then me)
Thanks for the positive message dude. I def hope it gets better sometime

OP, please listen to this advice right here. The world will be a lesser place without you!
Haha thanks. It never really was body issues (that pimples have been good to me so far is one of the few things I feel blessed about) 

My main issue has been just compartmentalizing my emotions to the point where I cannot open up to my closest friends, let alone a stranger. Also I don't feel satisfied or engaged by what I'm doing in school rn. I thought I'd just finish school and follow my passions after that, but I feel my resolve fading.

I've been going to counseling for the past few weeks now and I'm trying to get my life back on track but it's been hard and I haven't felt any significant improvement so..... yeah.
You're evil.
Okay man, but seriously, know that even if I'm someone you've never met, you still matter to me. I dont care if I dont know you personally, itd still hurt to have you die. Please do message me if you want to converse.
I’m glad to hear you are seeing a counselor. That’s honestly the bravest, strongest thing you can do. Life can be hard, but it is absolutely worth living. Speak to a suicide hotline. Tell your counselor exactly what you’re feeling and what you told us. Your life is worth living.
I'll send you my number too man! I'm a good conversationalist.
Yeah,I'm not even sad or anything but that put a warm feeling in my stomach
Exactly. I went through the same thing as him. Yet here i am a few years later cuddling with my gf playing fortnite lol
Aww, thanks! I’ve had some help along the way. 😄
No problem! Stay positive 😁
DUDE. I had the same mindset (I’m gonna keep all my problems to myself because I don’t want to inconvenience my friends) but eventually my friend told me that me not opening up to her felt way worse than dumping my shit on her because she was worried and she took it as a sign that I could not trust her enough. Think about it. If your close friend was suicidal, you would want them to talk to you than not. Being there for each other’s lows, that’s what friends are for man. It’s not a competition of who has it worse. They care about you and love you man. Please talk to them. You’re not a burden or inconvenience, you might think that way but those are thoughts, not facts. People are willing to help and support you but they won’t know unless you reach out.
Use it for your own advantage them being strangers, they can't and won't judge you after all they barely know you. If you put your best in it, it's bound to happen, it might take more time than you anticipated but it will come true because you work on it. Having friends with similiar issues can actually help all of you, you can motivate each other, encourage each other, get help together and get over it together. For the medical issue I just hope the treatment works out, don't delay getting one. You'll never know unless you try man you just have to try, we can't know when our life will end but we can make the most of it.
Couple things. First off, helping you will help your friends feel better too. So let them help. Second, they would much rather spend some time helping you than have you dead. Trust me. Spend some time over on r/suicidebereavement if you wanna k ow what the aftermath is like. (Please don't post suicidal ideation over there though,  that's a trigger.)
Sometimes talking to a complete stranger is liberating. You can say anything, and they don't have any context by which to judge you. There are no consequences. You just hang up and go about your business, and you don't have to run into them the next day. 

&#x200B;

PM me. You don't have to wait until you "need it most". I'll give you my cell if you'd like, and we can just talk about stuff.
It really will! Seriously, counselling suuucks at 1st because you're reliving all the bullshit. Once you got that out of the way, It's time to heal and move on. You're almost at the next stage dude, hang In there ✌
Idk what happened to my reddit but it showed my comment a few times and then I deleted it for lack of confusion and now I don’t know what’s going on lol I did reply somewhere haha
I hope you don’t feel that way because of your perception of your looks(which is a lot of people and that’s why I say that). You look completely fine to me. I genuinely hope you aren’t serious about following through. Life is rough sometimes and it can even seem like the bad won’t end but there are lots of positive things to look at. Wherever you live please try to get some help (hotline, local support group, etc.). I’ve dealt with my share of really rough times the last year and not going to lie I felt like I wanted it all to end but I didn’t do any of it. It’s got better. Find a balance and find a support group that can bring the positive sides to you. You are loved even if you don’t always feel it 😊
Thanks for your offer. I'll definitely keep you in mind when I need someone to ping
Yeah I went for treatment like a few years back for it. Luckily we caught the problem before it got too serious so I was just put on medication and given an emergency pill to take if the problem ever flared up all of a sudden. I quit the medication because on Doc's recommendation but it's coming back. Will def head for another checkup.

I'll take a little bit of hope from your message and carry it on now. Maybe I might pull through who knows
Yeah I got the reply. I may actually try pinging you once. Maybe if you tell me which time zone you live in I could work something out
Please do. The world is better with you in it.
I’m on the West coast if the US now
Oof I'm in India. It could mean well over 9 hours of difference between us. Let's see what works for you and I'll check if I can make it work
Depression sucks dude I’m sorry. I’m the same age as you and working with the elderly lately has taught me that we’re really young and have so much time to figure out what we want to do. I’ve dropped out of two programs so far and do I feel like a guilty failure sometimes too? Yes I do, but realizing that something isn’t for you or needing to take a break from something when you don’t have the energy to get through it doesn’t make you a failure. As for the handsome thing - depression can warp our view of ourselves and make us see ourselves through an “ugly” lens when in reality (and ESPECIALLY) in your case - we are very good looking and deserve to look in the mirror and see the most attractive face in the universe!
You look like a super stylish guy! Don’t let depression get in the way of your dreams and passions!
As an unbiased stranger I can say that no way are you miles from being handsome, you are a handsome guy for sure. I’ve been in a similar situation myself recently and as someone who’s on the road to recovery I can tell you that it does get easier and you are stronger than you know. Hope this helps and you’re having a great day!
Hey dude you ever look at someone that doubts their ability or looks and you think to yourself - what are they talking about, they are so talented or handsome?!? That’s where I’m at with your post. Depression is messing with you and your ability to see it but from the outside looking in, as a guy who gains nothing by saying this to you - you are a handsome guy. That beard, your facial structure, the eyes. You aren’t lacking at all in the handsome department. Build some confidence back up and ladies watch out!

You have a good way with words too that not every one has, take a break but don’t give up the creative writing just yet. There’s a spark of something there and I honestly believe in your ability.

One last thing, you post some genuine comments on this sub for other people when they are down which shows you to be a caring and genuine person. Even with your ups and downs you find some time to be a positive moment in other peoples lives and I love you for that. The world needs more people like you. Hang in there, work through this bout and bounce back even stronger
Mate, I just want to join the people telling you that you're handsome. You are legitimately fit as*. 

Depression has been kicking my arse recently as well. I hope you're getting the help you need i.e. medication/therapy or at least thinking about it.

Hang on mate. You have so much to offer to the world :) xx
You look like a genuinely good person.
You look great and thanks for the comments you are doing a great job and we need more of your kind on this planet!

Have a great Day!
happy belated born day! you’re handsome, and your eyes are very kind even while they hold the weight of everything you’re going through. give yourself some of the kindness you give others and some of the grace you deserve too. you need some respite right now and that’s okay. sending you lots of love ❤️
Handsome man! Thank you for commenting to help others even when you’ve been feeling down - it says so much about someone. I’ve changed career directions too many times to count and I’m still here and I’m still learning and I’m happy for every decision. You’ll find what works for you! Be kind to yourself, and while you work on that just bask in the kindness of us.
Woah dude, I’m a girl and I think you are incredibly attractive- not just saying that to make you feel better, it’s true. You also have such a kind looking face and look very friendly and approachable.
Depression sucks so much... it really does a great job of making you feel worthless. I promise you’re not a failure. You’re a really handsome guy! I bet you have a great sense of humor too! It’s so hard to try to find enjoyment in things when depression has ahold of you. I hope you find happiness and purpose soon! If you ever need anyone to chat with or a friend to listen I’m always down to talk! I hope you have a fantastic week friend!
Hey, you are very handsome!!! I know as a man in the world we live in today it is harder to express any emotion or hardship. Thank you for sharing your struggle with depression. And thank you for fighting your fight. Remember that depression is a lying monster and the negative things that you think about yourself are not true. Keep fighting and much love to you ❤️❤️❤️
Miles from being ha- what the fuck? No man. You look like smooth blues with a side of whiskey. The fact that you're a writer is just another layer of kick-ass on the cake you're taking. Look for new things, they're not in short supply. You're set, my friend. Stay strong 💪 We need you out here.
You are miles from being handsome. Precisely, 0 miles. You're already there. You look awesome. I hope you can feel awesome someday too.
Happy belated birthday!! 
Depression is a b*tch my dude so I hope you have a good support system or a therapist you can talk to. I'm proud of you for reaching out for a toast! For people who like to give it can be hard to realise when you need to fill your own cup. 

Depression can make it hard to find joy in things that used to make you happy. Even in the bad days, there are short moments of goodness. They might be short, fleeting moments, but it's important to seek them out and try to hold onto them. Giving up on your interests even if you don't feel the same passion can make it harder to pull yourself out of a bad place. This isn't meant to sound preachy, but please don't give up on what makes you happy.

On a superficial note, I think you're very handsome. You have nice clear skin, you have really beautiful eyes, and you have nice eyebrows.
I am really not good at complimenting someone, but I wish the best for you. Don't give up and don't let depression take control over you, I know what it feels like. Talk to people you love, let them help you :)
Depression sucks man it really does but you just got to realize its affecting how you see yourself but not how others see you . Imagine seeing yourself walking down the street like, "Daaaaaammn" You're a handsome dude and you got a good future ahead of you, you just have to see it. Good luck in life man!
These words really hit me in the best way. Thank you for taking the time to answer. Sometimes it all gets heavy in my mind and I just can't see how am I supposed to make it? I'll keep fighting, thank you so much for the kind words. I hope things are good for you!
Thank you! I'll keep fighting!
Thank you for taking the time to read me out. I hope things are going well for you! It helps to see someone who understands these vibes. Thank you again!
Man did I need that! Thank you for the words, it really means a lot to me. I always try to be the positive force around, but there are times when I feel helpless. I love you too! You got me smiling like a fool on my phone aha. I will keep fighting. Thank you again so much! I hope life is treating you as much as you deserve!
I appreciate the love bud, means a lot. Depression sure sucks, I hope you get through and you got the help you need too. You deserve the best things this world can give! Thank you so much for caring!
Thank you, it means a lot! I'm always self-conscious about how I look and the image I project
Thank you so much! Have a great day too!
Thank you for answering! I just find it hard sometimes to appreciate the guy I see in the mirror... It helps to know that people believe in me. Thank you so much again💙
Tbh, I didn't expect so much love, I feel overwhelmed! Thank you for answering me, I'm so stressed about the future when I see the kids who used to be behind me getting their lives together while I'm still here wondering how to get through my days. Thank you for the advice, it helps to see someone who have been through it, making it in one piece! I hope life treats you well friend, thank you so much!
Thank you, I would blush if I could! It really means a lot to hear that, my looks is one thing I have always struggled with, but I'll be working on it! Thank you again for taking the time to read me out (:
Thank you for the kind words! I'm not sure I have a great sense of humour, I mostly do bad puns and feel like I'm awkward aha... Thank you for caring, it means a lot to me to know you're willing to hear me out💙
That's the strength of depression, sometimes you just can't see the difference between what's real and what's not. It still feels odd to me to talk about myself like I did, but I guess it's the first step to recovery. Thank you a lot for helping me today, it means a lot 💙💚💙
Man you should be the writer! You have me dazzled! I don't see myself as a writer just yet, but your words are inspiring me! Thank you so much for the support! I hope life is 💯 💯💯 with you!!
Thank you, you got me smiling like a fool here 💙
Thank you for the kind words, it's appreciated! I hate the feeling of not enjoying things that used to make me happy anymore, I'll keep trying to get back at it! Thank you for listening to my rant. It means a lot to me and I hope life is good on you friend!
you’re welcome, i most definitely believe in you ❤️
Everybody has their own path, you’re gonna be so great. Lots of light and love from across the ocean 💗
Hey, asolutely! Listen. Everybody deserves to be loved, everybody deserves to know they have value. You have plenty. Let me know how you're doing some time, keep in touch. We all gotta stick together in life, there's no room for division. Bless you, and good luck!
Bro, you're a gem. I won't forget that!
You’re very cute: you have beautiful eyes, great pots and pans, and a curious metal antenna in the center of your head. The world is your oyster! 😊♥️
My dude

You have the most beautiful stars in your eyes 💖
You said it yourself, it was a bad relationship. Hurray for you my friend! Ypu will feel better! Smile and banish that sadness from your beautiful eyes!
You are cute as hell and seriously pull off the short hair look!
You’re so good looking! Your eyes are amazing, and you’re really pulling off a shaved head! Take some time to recover and afterwards i’m sure you won’t find any difficulty going on dates.
Congratulations on your escape - the hardest part is behind you now. And here you are, picking yourself up and moving forward!
You got out so you know your on the right path. The next few days/weeks/months may be rocky but once that hold has loosened on you then you'll be on your way with someone better and a better outlook on life and it won't be long before your on here helping people that are in the position you was in. Cause you my friend frickin rock
Hey! I broke up with my ex 3 months ago and I understand that it's not easy. But I do believe that everything happens for a reason. Heartbreak is a part of life and it's almost impossible to avoid. It will eventually get easier and you seem like a very amazing dude. The future is bright! :)
You look like one of the Jonas brothers lol. And that is not an insult in the slightest of course.
you’ve got eyes that smize
You have beautiful doe eyes! 

Don't worry, things get better. If it was a bad relationship anyway, it's all for the best. You will find the right person. 

Also make sure to love yourself! Find one thing a day that you like about yourself. :)

Good luck!
Not a lot of guys can pull off a shaved head but you can! <3
It gets better, trust me. And you look better when you smile :)
It takes so much courage and strength to get out of a bad relationship and you shouldn't feel bad at all. Feel proud of yourself! You got through this so you can most certainly get through anything else you put your mind to! 

Also just remember to take some personal self care time for yourself, getting out of bad relationships can be draining and you deserve to reward yourself or time to take care of yourself. Whether that's going to a restaurant you normally don't go to often because it's fancy/costly or surrounding yourself with people who do love and care about you! It's just a good idea to not lock yourself in the house after ending a relationship especially if it might've been a little toxic. But don't worry the pain of it is going to pass soon!
cool hairline!
Bro. You’ll realize this is the best thing to happen to you. Bad relationships can make you feel worthless, but you’re a good looking dude with a bright future ahead! Chin up!
Your eyes are so beautiful and powerful. Your sadness feels palpable to me, but there's something so lovely and noble in it. Not only do you look great, but it speaks highly of your instincts that you knew where to turn when feeling low. 

I hope you can really internalize the kind things others in these comments have said - you're not just going to be all right. You're going to be amazing. You already are.
You're a handsome bloke with a good set of saucepans. If I was single I'd be messaging you lol 😅
It's not a fun place to be, my dude. But given this was a bad relationship, you'll be grateful you jumped ship when the mate who is right for you comes along :-)
Oh my god, if I was single right now.... oh wait, I am single... Where do you live? 😜
You're too handsome to be feeling bad about what should be good news - it was crappy, and you're out of it. Take those dark, mysterious eyes and go flirt it up, find the lady (or man, or both if that's your kicks) of your dreams and make them wonder what makes a man like you tick.
Disastrously handsome my friend. Be strong, stay true to yourself, and take one step forward every day, big or small. You've got this.
love that paint, youre hot, byeeee.
You seem very handsome and have kind eyes. I know coming out of a bad relationship is rough, but maybe it's like spring cleaning, and now you can meet your soul mate (or at least a great date).

&#x200B;

Good luck out there, and have a great day.
Thank you 😊, yeah as soon as I posted the pic I noticed it too 🙄😂
🥂 toast the toaster for a great toast. Short but very good.
Thank you very much 😊
Thanks, the short hair is usually a hit or miss kinda situation haha 😂
Haha I’ve been called worse 😂
Thank you very much ☺️
Haha why thank you 😅😅
Well I’ll take that as a compliment 👀👀
Thanks mate!
You have such a beautiful smile! You look nothing near 50, to me you look below 30! Take care of yourself, dont let your diabetes put you down. It doesnt define you as a person!
32???? You look like you’re still in college! I want you to give yourself a hug and say “I love myself” whenever you feel like this
A bright, shiny person isn't bright and shiny because they never feel pain, or tiredness, or exhaustion. It's because they are passionate about their impact on the world, and the energy they give to those around them.

You are not a fake. You are not a failure. You care about bringing that light to the world, and that's all anyone ever tries to do.

Give yourself a break, let your energy recover. Everyone needs to do that :)
Your smile brightened my timeline! I'm sure you brighten up the days of people around you. Keep smiling and Take care of yourself dear!
You have a great smile!! Keep your chin up! It will get better. Always does!!
You look so pretty and sweet! great energy in this picture.
Are you sure your not early 20's and having us on cause that's what it seems like. Nah your not a hypocrite either, just trying to look after others who would worry about you.
You look amazing! I legitimately thought you were in your mid-twenties MAX. :0

Also what kind of Asian are you? Sorry if this seems invasive, you don’t have yo answer, but I always ask fellow Asians what kind they are out of curiosity. 😅 (I’m half-Filipino myself!)
You have a nice smile.
I have type 2 diabetes and I noticed that when I get enough sleep, eat responsibly and get active I feel much better.
You look sad behind that beautiful smile, but your beauty still shines through.
You have a very lovely smile and kind eyes! I'd also like to say, it doesn't make you a hypocrite to act that way, if that's who you want to be. I applaud you for keeping a positive outlook in your day to day life, even when your body conspires against that. It can't be easy, but you stay true to who you are, and who you want to be. We all have inner demons that tear us apart from the inside, but people like you keep on going in spite of that, and that's very admirable.

&#x200B;

Please keep that smile, and have a beautiful day!
As a fellow diabetic I feel your pain. 

But damn if I look like you when I'm 32 I'll be hella happy. You look so youthful and you radiate positive energy. I'm willing to bet your bright shiny personality brightens the day of everyone around you.
You have great skin for 32.
Your skin is really beautiful, and you just look so kind and warm! Definitely one of those people I would just look at and think "wow, she's beautiful in so many ways"
You got this!! ✌❤
Hi op! You have got a heart warming smile. You are a brave person for smiling even in the face of tough times,now I am not going to ask you to rough it out,  catharsis is important ,  talk to someone, let it all out. Keep kicking op, you got this!
Oh now I know the reason why you are so sweet. Diabetes. Huh. Just kidding. Times can be rough but wasting such a pretty smile for that, i would recommend you to keep smiling. Also your hair looks amazing
You really smile with your eyes! And nice ring—clearly somebody loves you, which isn’t surprising :P
Hi Kitchpats. :) We all hide our pain sometimes. People routinely tell me how cheerful and peppy I am, for example, but I have major recurrent depression (a permanent kind of sad-brains that needs medicine). Most people are taken aback when they learn this.

Smiling and trying to be normal through difficult times does *not* make you a hypocrite. You're keeping your chin up and paddling along while dealing with some real problems that affect your day to day life. Maybe you don't want to talk about them to everyone, so you smile to get through conversations. That's alright! There is nothing wrong with that.

When you need to be sad or feel ready to be sad (since that moment might not come up with other people around), *let yourself be sad* and do the things you need to when you feel down, sleep in, watch some crummy movies, treat yourself. I don't think enough people allow themselves to have negative emotions these days, and as a result, they expect far too much of themselves and become more distressed when they don't meet their own lofty expectations. Remember to be kind to yourself, as no one will judge you as harshly as you.
Fellow Diabetic here. That's not being a hypocrite, that's resilience. Diabetes drags everyone who has it down, it's a sucky disease that seems to be hard to understand if you don't have. Sometimes it's hard to understand when you do have it. You're not alone, Diabetes UK has an affiliated message board for anyone affected by it, whether you're from the UK or not. They will make you feel welcome, give you a shoulder to cry on and let you be friends with them. I think it's www.diabetessupport.co.uk. Although a lot of the technical advice on there is for UK folks (free meds but patchy access to tech, pumps, meters and in some cases strips) wherever you're from I'm sure you'd be welcome.

Don't let your Pancreas get you down.
😜
Well if one thing is for sure, you are absolutely GORGEOUS!!! That color also looks amazing on you!!
You look like a literal ray of sunshine, and your smile made ME smile! You're exactly the kind of girl I'd love to be friends with =)
You look like you would be a loyal friend :)
Feel like fifty u look 25
You may feel tired and burnt out, but I can see through your smile that there is still a warm and sunny side to you that's wanting to be free and wanting to be out and ready to shine. You've got a fighting spirit in you, and even though you may not feel that spirit right now it's still there. You got this!
Your willingness to cheer others up when you need cheering up says allot about you. Go find a friend and get some hugs. They work wonders!
You look mid twenties. I want to know your secret. 😂 I’m sorry to hear about the health issues, but you must be doing many things right to look so young and vibrant!
You're 50!?! You look great! such a warm and sweet smile. Please take care of yourself
You’re not a hypocrite! You’re a beautiful soul sharing what light you do have, despite feeing burnt out. Remember it’s ok to show what you’re feeling, too, that way others can light you up! You’re doing so great dealing with all the troubles of everyday life + health problems. It’s so draining!! That’s how Ik you’re incredibly strong! This won’t break you. You will get through this!! Your smile perfectly matches that spark of hope in your eye, and we’ll keep being your cheer squad for as long as you need us!!
Kind eyes and a kind smile, I don't think your pretending to be happy. It's OK to feel bad sometime, go easy in yourself
Remember that every human being is beautiful, d9nt let anyone make you feel down you are beautilfuil, unique. Focus on becoming a better version of yourself, forget the past, learn the mistakes and fix them. Leave the mental enivornmenglt your brain is living it and take it to a ppsitive enivornment 😁 spend time with positive people. Hope this helped, if yu wanna take more just dm. Good luck sister
You smile is beautiful, your eyes are very very kind. Hope you feel as great as you look from now on.
Your teeth. Like pomegranate.  I want your teeth omg
Holy heck your skin is so clear and you look so youthful, genuinely thought you were ~25 before i saw the caption!! Its not hypocritical to pretend to be happy, sometimes you have to fake it until you make it but i hope that one day you wont have to pretend anymore <3
You have such beautiful teeth! Your hair is gorgeous also! Xxxx
You look great!
But you’re still gorgeous!
You have a lovely, fresh face and an aura of goodness.
Are you asian, because you look am-asian (play on the word amazin').

This is in no way a racist pun, in fact I am asian myself. I want you to know you're doing great, and that it takes a special, rare type of person to keep smiling through bad days. Stay cute sweetie!
You are only a child :) Wait until you get to be MY age (65 Yikes!!!!). You are beautiful and have a beautiful smile 😊
You're doing great honey! You have such a beautiful smile! Everyone gets burnt out sometimes but just remember to take breaks sometimes. Take a nice bath, pick up a book, turn on your favorite movie! Whatever makes you feel happy inside that can stop you from feeling burnt out, even if for a little, can make such a difference! You got this!
I'm a woman of 31 struggling with depression, and I'm super proud of you. It takes a hell of a lot of effort to be 'bright and shiny' when you're totally not in the mood, and you're an absolute superstar for trying this hard.

I'm similar in that I need to be 'bright and shiny' when I'm at work, but it's all an act really. The way I rationalise it is.... Trying to spread positivity is a noble goal. The fact that you want to do that *despite* your own problems, means that you're probably a deeply caring person. Which means you're probably not as awful/hypocritical as you feel like you are.

That's the way I try to feel about myself, anyway :)
Type 1 here and it is very tough battling this disease everyday. No two days are alike, and sometimes it is just overwhelming. 

A lifelong battle has it's ups and downs. Right now is a rough patch, but you'll persevere. Humor has always helped me through my sugar spikes and lows. 

DM me if you ever want to share ideas or have questions. I've had it for 17yrs and it's always uplifting to help someone on this journey. I sincerely wish you all the best!
You are amazing, beautiful, and you rock! You don't always have to pretend to be happy. Wearing the mask can drain you of way more energy than diabetes can. Cry it out if you have to. You'll find the light at the end of the tunnel soon. In the meantime, just make it through one day at a time! You got this!
Bro this hit home hard for me. I know how you feel. Wearing a mask constantly with no time to take it off... It sucks. But keep your chin up sweetheart! If a dredge like me can do it, I'm positive you can do it too! Just make sure to take some time for yourself! You deserve a good pampering!
Your skin is so beautiful!!! And I love your hairstyle. Plus your taste in stationery is killer. I would love to be your friend
You! Are! Kicking! Diabetes’! Ass! 
As another diabetic person,  you are never doing as badly as you think you are. No way. You deal with so much and you’re entitled to feel down every so often. 
And you shouldn’t feel like a hypocrite - you’re just a normal person trying to keep afloat regardless of external factors. 
Keep it up!!!! Positivity is key! You’re stronger than you know and things will get easier. But at the same time? Recognise your feelings and that you need breaks from time to time. Give yourself those breaks. Everyone needs them, it doesn’t make you weak at all. It makes you human.
Talk to people you trust! Let them in, and let them support you. This can be daunting but so worth it. You have the strength you need to get through this, and you will. 
By the way? You have a really lovely smile.
You are greater than your highs and lows. BG and A1C are just numbers, not measurements of your worth. 

T1D bites, and it can help to connect with people who get it. There are a lot of volunteer opportunities that come with a beautiful built-in support network. Happy to help you connect to one in your area, if desired. 

T1 friends can help you feel whole again even after your endo rips you a new one. Wish you well!
You seem like a kind soul, something the world is tragically lacking. Put that to good use helping others through their hard times, and yours will get better. You have value, and you have purpose. Hope things get better for you soon!
You're so cute. You look 23, not 32! Take a nap - whenever I feel terrible and want to give in, turns out I am just tired. Find some diabetic groups to kvetch with, I know there must be a ton out there!
I'm going to say that if I was a liquor store clerk and you came in to purchase alcohol and the age was 21 I would be really looking at your ID to make sure you are over 21. Not saying you look super young either but I wouldn't have guessed 32 at all 23 tops.
You are bright and shiny though. I'd give you a solid 25 tops.
My experience has been that when I was younger and apparently a cutie I never believed it or could see it due to very low self esteem. As you go through life and begin to learn your own self worth, I think you’ll realize long before I did that you truly are very attractive. But what really makes us beautiful is what shines through from the inside.  May your journey be filled with self realization.
You are so pretty. Your skin glows, and your hair looks beautiful. I am sorry you are going through so much mentally abd struggling with your illness, but physically you look so happy and healthy. You also seem very kind.
You're not a hypocrite. You're putting others first. Which is a wonderful thing but you also have to take care of you. Take a bath, have your favorite treat (that's safe lol) and take some time for you. You deserve it.
You have such an incredible smile! And your skin is perfect 😱 you’re gorgeous! Always remember to take a few minutes out of your day to care for yourself! I understand what it’s like to struggle with an illness, it’s important to do things you enjoy as often as you can!
You're not a hypocrite. You're trying. There's a difference, and good for you for fighting the good fight 💗
Thank you, dear! This illness is taking me down lately, I need to reboot my thinking that this shouldn’t define me.
I've already commented but have to second this opinion. What I'd do for a smile like that!!
Aww!  Thank you!! I love myself, I love myself!
Thank you for the reminder. I do need to recover! ❤️
Take care, too! Thank you ❤️
Looking forward to better days! Thank you ❤️
Thank you ❤️
Thank you but I wish I’m back in my early 20s, I miss my youthful energy!
Heya! I’m 💯 Filipino ❤️ thanks for the kind words, mickee_vee ❤️ it’s amazing to receive a comment from a fellow pinoy 🇵🇭
It gets the best of me, sometimes, but I choose to fight and survive. Have you experienced pain in the legs at night because that’s what’s keeping me up late sometimes.
Have a wonderful day, too! Thank you ❤️
Thank you for the kind words ❤️ I hope my smile helps them through their day ☀️
Thank you ❤️
Thank you, that’s truly uplifting ❤️
Keep reaching to get it ❤️
Thank you for the faith! ❤️
Hehe! Diabetic smile? Lol. Thanks for the kind words ❤️
Thank you! My eyes may be tired but it will never stop from smiling :)
Thank you pom_pom for your wisdom. Yes, I feel like I should let my guard down and get in touch with my feelings. My upcoming 14-hr solo flight might be the perfect timing for that. I hope you are doing fine with your sad brain, if not, I’d be more than happy to give you affirmation.
My pancreas wants to high five yours! Thanks! This is awesome, I’ll try this link! And you’re right, this illness is difficult to understand from the outside— hence it can be dragging sometimes when u try to explain it to others.
Super thanks ❤️
I can be your friend :)
I think I am :)
You are too kind! Thank you!
Thank you for the inspiring words. Hoping for better days ahead!
Thank you!! Virtual hugs to you ❤️
I started going to the gym for starters :) I’m a plus size girl trying to be more active to get a good sugar reading :) thank you for the compliment ❤️
Oh, I’m only 32 but I feel like I’m 50. My energy is kinda low lately :( thank you for the kind words ❤️
You’re sweet, thank you! Sometimes I just feel tired of dealing with this illness but I know there’s no other choice but to keep on moving forward ❤️
Try your best to keep your sugars on point! Keep your chin up too!! I was diagnosed at 29 w type 1 along w Graves’ disease. It’s been a long road but keep that positivity and smile up :) you got this!!!
Thank you for the sweet words ❤️
Thank you ❤️ I will try my best to not let this illness get the best of me ❤️
I appreciate the sweet compliments, thank so much ❤️
Thanks :) trying my best to keep the teeth healthy :)
Looking forward to that day ☀️ thank you ❤️
I guess I chose the perfect highlights for my skin tone, thank you ❤️
Thank you ❤️
Thank you ❤️ I want to see myself like that, too!
Thank you ❤️ you’re too kind ❤️
Yes, I’m an Asian hoping to be an am-asian :) hihi! Thank you for the kind words ❤️
Thanks for the reminder ❤️
Aww! Super thank you! Honestly, this illness is stopping me from enjoying as often as I can, but I need to find new things to enjoy that won’t interfere with my condition.
I’m thankful for being alive. I just want to rest for a while then live another day to fight this illness ❤️
Thanks, super ❤️
We all wish that bud, although maybe not my early 20's as i was a right dickhead sometimes then :-) and my missus would whinge even more about the age difference (she's older) :-)
I get leg pain, but that's from fibromyalgia. My feet have good circulation. 
I have arthritis, tendonitis and bone spurs in several joints. Also fallen arches. I hurts, but I try to stay active.
The worst thing to do is sit or lay around too long.
I rejoined a gym, that always helped my legs, back and midsection in the past. 

What other issues do you have?
Awesome! I'm the same age as you, and between husband, kids, and work, I pretty much have zero friends. I'll message ya!
I was going to the gym and still have the membership but never seem to make the time lately.  I think you are going to accomplish everything you’d to. Thanks for the inspiration. ☀️💛🌱💚
OHHH I misread. I'm so sorry. Trust me I get it lol I'm 31 and I feel the same way. You're beautiful and I hope your energy picks up :)
I get that:/ I struggle with my health on a daily basis, too, and Ik what it’s like to have poor quality of life for indefinitely long periods of time. It’s those brief windows of time when we feel better that we can recharge and remind ourselves of all the good and possibilities in this world. You’re not alone in this:) Don’t lose hope, your windows will come!!
Thanks for the positive thoughts! We can do this! Take care of yourself, too ❤️
No worries
Hehehe! You can go back to your early 20s and change that sometimes dickhead attitude. Lol. Your missus can also go back to her early 20s but then you might be in your teenage years if you move backwards further hihi! That would be cool! ☺️
I also joined the gym late last year but nerve pain at night is still there. I haven’t tried wearing compression socks though, it might help, i don’t know. Besides my legs, I’m having difficulty driving at night already. My last eye exam showed signs of glaucoma.
Anytime, dear ❤️ I’m a great listener ☀️
Thank you, too ❤️
Thank you ❤️
if she went back to her 20's i'd be around 10 - 15 ha ha. The age gets to her now, imagine that one hee hee
Have you tried biking? You work your whole body and it's not load bearing.
Also, you can do squats without added weight, using a chair as support. 
These activities both include working your large muscles and getting your circulation going. Also great for controlling your blood sugar.
I will add that to my routine. Ive been doing 30mins in the treadmill and the other 30mins doing weights. Thanks so much, I really hope this would help! It’s 2am now here and still can’t sleep because of the discomfort :(
I was like that all night. Getting moving was like trying to start a rusty old car
You said it, yeah, that’s what if feels like
My darling I love your glasses! I reckon you should get a lipstick the same colour! It really goes with your dark hair and eyes. 

I hope you have a lovely day!!
Sending love from someone else suffering the heat! I adore your little asymmetrical smile, super cute 💖
You look great, those glasses are really cute on you :)
I really like your hair, and looking through your profile, I definitely want to hang out with you
You look so sweet and have great hair!
You're so pretty! Intense heat will make the most self-confident of us rethink existence, but I bet you rock your life and make the people around you so happy with your presence and great smile
Ugh doesn’t the heat feel awful right now? I definitely feel ya. It just feels super gross... but that doesn’t mean YOURE gross :) you are a huge cutie! I really love your haircut! I hope you’re able to stay cool! Have a wonderful week :)
You're really cute. Love the glasses. And yes, heat is the worst
That's great advice, thank you!
Thank you so much! I never really 'learned' how to smile, but your kindness has me seeing it a little differently 💖
I mean, I'm down to chat if you want to haha
Had me in the first half, not gonna lie haha 
I had a hair appointment next week but it got cancelled, so I'm trying to figure out what to do with my hair now
Happy Birthday dawg! Shirt looks nice on you! What’s the tattoo of?
You're handsome and seem like a wonderful person to be around :) Happy Birthday!!!
Bicep goals 😱
Holy shit, I had no idea Mr. Incredible was on Reddit! Happy birthday man! I'm sorry things are rough. Keep your chin up, believe in yourself, and keep fighting. You look like a good soul and a born leader, you can handle anything that comes your way. Stay strong. We've got your back 💪
You look like a really genuine and down to earth guy! I hope you find yourself right where you need to be. Godspeed, friend.
Happy Birthday! And don't be down on yourself, he seems like a cool dude
Happy Birthday! Cheer up, dude! That frown doesn’t suit that face!
Heyy! You have a handsome and kind face!! I mean that! 💯

Happy birthday! I hope better and brighter days come find you very soon! ❤
heat sucks,  I hope you have fun and don't get too baked in the Desert.
Happily birthday!
Happy birthday! You look like a really sweet person, I'd love to give you a hug 🤗
Hey happy birthday! 36 and still a badass. Good job.
Oh hey, first ever silver.  Thank you, anonymous person!
Happy birthday pal
You look strong yet gentle. I bet someone wants to cuddle with you.
Dude idk much about you, but I can tell you for sure you’re attractive af.
Mjolnir, kind of a mashup of the old traditional style with the Marvel version and an inlaid triskelion pattern that I definitely did NOT base off of a weird mall-ninja throwing knife I found on Google.  Honest.
Ha, thanks.  The biceps are actually hiding under a bunch of loose skin from dropping weight lol
Fuck it dude, a cool tattoo is a cool tattoo. As long as it's well executed and you didn't get it for $20 from a backwater unlicensed ink shop, it could be the most mall ninja shit possible and still be badass.
Good fucking shit bro! Keep it up
you have nice eyebrows and i love your curly/wavy hair!! you look like a very kind person, all the best :)
Relax buddy, we are coming. Things may not be great right now but tomorrow’s gonna be better. Also you got those soft eyes look going for you. Pretty jealous my boy. Hahah
I absolutely adore your eyes! They are beautiful!
nice hair
You have beautiful eyes and kind face. Don't be too hard on yourself. 🤗
You look super cute!
You seem like a teddy bear, chill dog, chill.
I love your hair and you have nice eyes :)
Whoa! Your eyes are beautiful!!! 💯
You have the hair I wish I could pull off. It’s a yes from me
What stunning eyes!
Stunning eyes and lashes women pay a ton trying to achieve!
Aaaaw! You give the impression you are one of those really awesome teddy-bear guys. A lot of women love these laid back dudes that they can hug them and feel safe with. You will for sure attract some really nice ladies and I am pretty sure they will be in good hands - or should I say teddy paws....? 😘
Hey man, it's tough out here. Guys gotta be better than ever, the failures of the men before us mean we're held to a high standard. But you can do this. Good eyes, strong features, and lovable hair? You're set for looks my friend. Follow your heart, stay strong, and be your best self. The good times will come.
Guys really should be complimented more. I don't get why they're not. You have really pretty eyes.
You look very chill and friendly and had that loyal bro vibe coming outta you. Hope your days will get better man.
now to anxiously wait and check the comments every 2 minutes!
You look really good, and you have kind eyes that look like you know how to laugh. I'm sure you bring joy to everyone in your life.
What?? I love your nose! Your brows will grow out.
Those eyes, the hint of smile on your lips, the quirky mess in your hair, that "girl next door" vibe... cute and hot!
Oooo thank you all for being so darling! it’s real chalmomile-like to me.
Um...you’re gorgeous! You give me Carey Mulligan vibes:)
Aww you're simply adorable! Those little things that you think are imperfection is what makes your absolutely perfect. You have a face that someone could crush on quite easily. You also look like you have a big heart and a gentle soul. Work with what you have and you have quite a lot to work with. Keep your head up. You're simply exquisite 😁
You have big beautiful eyes and I love your cute nose. I bet the rest of you is just as beautiful.
You look way better than you give yourself credit for. Nothing wrong with your nose for starters.
I love you face! I love you hair!!! I love everything about how you look! In fact I want to look like you 😍 chin up, darling! From what I see, you're a 10! 

Here's hoping that someday you're gonna see yourself as what you truly are - BEAUTIFUL. ❤
You look like the best looking Angeline Jolie and if I could draw then you'd be the perfect second model (the first would have to be my wife :-).

&#x200B;

Your self perception is obviously not that great :-) as look at these comments, your gonna make everybody who walks past you feel a little better about themselves
You are adorable! I love everything about you (that I can see, hehehe). You would definitely catch my eye we’re we to cross paths
You should give yourself some credit! You look amazing! Your nose looks perfect on you, and your eyebrows look great too!
you're beautiful girl!! keep your chin up!
You have seriously beautiful facial features. Your nose shape is beautiful. I actually think your eyebrows also suit your face despite not being the style that's "in" right now. Your hair really suits you too. Basically you are gorgeous but you also look like you would have an awesome personality too.
Those cheekbones! Those lips! You could be a model, looks like you have exactly the slim build and elegant, dramatic features that they look for.
Your haircut is SO flattering on you! You’re seriously super pretty! I also think you have a cute smile! Sorry you’re feeling down on yourself but just know that this stranger thinks you’re gorgeous! Have a great week :)
You remind me of the princess from Frozen
You look very kind.
Gee thank you again to all of you! I never expected to blush so much. You’re all super duper wonderful!
You have a great smile, it's the smile of a person who can take on anything because they have a joy within :)
You’re radiant!
I agree with the others, that's a smile and a half and you'll bring happiness to others just by them seeing it. To help with your writers block, write a teensy tiny story/poem/paragraph about a little ant landing on the moon.
All these things going wrong and you *still** have such a gorgeous smile! Your eyes are so sparkly and I really do agree with the commenter who called you ‘radiant’ (it’s the best word to sum up your look that I can think of!)
They are. I know you're strong though. And you're really pretty.
Oh no. Those all sound terrible. I can't even imagine what it's like going through just one of them, but you're experiencing them all at once. 😕

I hope things go well for you someday. You remind me of JK Rowling who was rejected 12 times for her crazy magic fiction book, and I hope you have achieve the same success as her. Stay strong 💚
You're beautiful, and your skin looks perfect!
Your skin is flawless and I’m loving those earrings!
I know smiling through the pain works most of the time, probably cause you have a beautiful smile, but it’s also important to take care of yourself! Make sure not to push yourself too hard. I hope things get better.
You have a beautiful smile, all the more for the struggles behind it. I know it may not seem that way now, but as long as you keep trying and remain true to yourself, *your struggles make you better.* keep pushing through the dark, and you will find joy and beauty, eventually.
You are absolutely STUNNING and those bangs look great on you. 

It’s ok to not be strong sometimes, it’s ok to have depression. Your pain is real. 

I wish you the speediest recovery possible.
It is a struggle,  but take it day by day. Step by step. You're doing great!
Looks like you’re in a cubicle, at work, amirite? That right there shows me how strong you are. You’re out there fighting every day 

You are strong, you are worthy, and I salute you.
The fact that your smiling says a lot about your inner strength that you haven’t acknowledged yet
You're really strong, and also really pretty. I hope it gets easier.
You are so so gorgeous and deserve time and love directed at yourself. I hope everyone can support you as much as you support them. Fake till you make it and also reach out 💕
You’re doing a great job!!!!! I’m proud of you and sending you love!!! You look like someone i could giggle for hours with
I hope you have a good support system to help you with the depression because no one deserves to feel that way. Keep that beautiful smile going, write the bad days like yesterday in sand, not stone!
Take time for yourself, please. Do something that makes YOU feel good! You're beautiful!
You're smiling, you're fighting, and each day you go is one more day you kicked the ass of life itself when it told you that you couldn't. You have the strength, courage, and will that moves mountains. You feel the pain but just keep rolling. So don't let it get you down, just go on being the fucking badass that you are!
you have amazing cheekbones <3
Girl, I'm calling Area 51 on you, that beauty is out of this world. Who sent you? Because I'm sure you are not only pretty but valid and you are worth it as much as any other human being on this planet. 

Please take care of your mental health and seek help if you need it, don't smile through your pain, smile because you feel happy. Don't be afraid to talk about it, mental issues are nothing to feel shame about. Please don't underestimate yourself and, of course, don't overexert youself :)
☺ thank you so much
Aww thank you
Thank you so much. I'm hoping i can fake it till I make it
Thank you ❤
Thank you so much🤗
Thank you
Thank you🤗
Thank you. I'm trying to tap into it
Aww thank you so much🤗
Thank you❤
thank you!! Yes, I'm very silly so that's likely lol
Thank u. Happy cake day
lol you're awesome!! thank you
thank you :)
this was so sweet!! thank you, truly :)
This is much more than I deserve for failing to mention how sick your cheekbones are. Like, no contour needed, 100% all natural poke-you-in-the-eye sculpted realness. 

A thousand apologies for the oversight.
Thank you!
Thank you!! You're too kind
At least you’re super cute!
Nice piercings and tattoos, you totally look like the kind of person I'd love to be friends with.
Florida state bird biting your butt. Lol Sometimes you just grin and bear it. Lol
Your hair looks so floofy and soft, I love it!
I really like the glasses and earrings on you. And a quick look at your profile and I already want to hang out with you
As someone who's trans, I hear too many horribly sad stories. I'm glad you made it through. This journey every trans person is on can be incredibly difficult, but you are amazing! The fact that you don't know just how awesome you are makes you even cooler! It's really hard to be brave enough to come out, but you did it! I still can't come out yet myself, but I dream of the day where I'm in a position that I can. You also look really handsome!

&#x200B;

Be wonderful to yourself, you deserve only the best!
That’s a cool hairdo
You have amazing eyes. The kind that you are pulled into. They’re really something special. Also, I love your hair! You’re super handsome, seriously. I’m so happy you’re doing better, and I hope you have a wonderful day.
Hey bub, I'm glad you're still with us. I'm also glad you got the help you need. 

I want to say that I love you unconditionally, I think you're a very handsome feller, and everyday you make this world a more beautiful place just by being yourself.

Sending love, happiness, encouragement, hope, and other positive thoughts.

Cheers.
You seem extremely sweet, I feel so horrible that someone as beautiful as you is suffering from suicidal thoughts... I genuinely hope you get better, hang in there dude because it will get better <3 <3
Hey buddy. One of my best friends is a trans man, and he's certainly dealt with suicidal ideation (as have I.) Let me tell you what I would tell him if he were in a similar situation- *your hardships make you better.* The world is a better place for having you in it. I've been hospitalized for the same reason as you countless times, and while things may look dark now, *it does get better,* so long as you work hard and are true to yourself. I stress this last point most of all, be true to your own heart and the rest will follow. I believe in you ♥

Edit: I want to add that the friend I mentioned is one of the hippest, most stylish dudes I know, and you remind me a lot of him!
You are so handsome and strong!! Taking care of yourself, including your mental and physical health, is never a failure. You deserve to feel so proud.
There is no failure in seeking help. If you’re still here, you’re a winner.
You’re awesome, man!!! There is nothing wrong with needing professional help and those who accept it are so strong!!

You deserve to be happy.

Also eyeliner on point!!
And you're really good looking. It is not failure to need help. It is not a failure to get help. It is part of being human. I think you're strong for going in. And I hope you're happy back at home. I'm an 18 year old trans girl who's had similar problems. I wish you the best
You’re not a failure! You look very nice and I hope you feel the best you can!
Allow this to stoke your bright fire! If there’s any way, any way at all, that you can allow this to be a beautiful thing, that you’re here now on the other side, I can see in your face you’re going to change the lives of everyone you meet by sharing your story. Thank you for being here, you have a special lightness to you that is shown even in a photo.

Edit: for whatever reason just your face alone looks like someone I would be really really good friends with. Maybe in another universe, past or future. Hope to meet you, friend!!!
I remember trying to commit suicide at 18, that was "fun". The good news is you'll be fine. I'm 33 now and life got much better after I got agency over my life with a job of my own.

On the note of being a trans guy, if not for the make up, I'd of assumed male. So that seems to be going well for you.
So you're a guy...
You're not a failure for having gone, you're a hero for having made it through. You're not weak for thinking ill of yourself, it proves your strength that you fight back. You are a light in the darkness and I am encouraged by your courage to stand up, even to yourself.
Damn dude I dig your hairdo but fr tho never give up itll seem like shit but power through and it will get better I can personally guarantee it you just gotta work through it
Keep winning dude, you’re doing fantastic and we’re all so proud of you.
Suicidal ideation is the worst man I’m with you. It’s hard to not feel discouraged/disappointed/ashamed of hospitalized for me too, but I just try to remember that it just proves I’m a strong-ass motherfucker trying to care for myself, and that’s what you’re doing too! 
I’m proud of you for being hospitalized. It’s so easy to just choose not to. 
You’re an incredible, handsome, strong-ass man and I hope you’re having a great day, and see a cute animal of your favorite sort.
My man, everything brave is going to be labeled as failure by those less brave than you. I’m proud of you for taking care of yourself. Also I’m really, really, really attracted to you ok bye
You look great! And you sure know how to take good pictures of yourself. I really admire that.
Furthermore, kickass wings, I fuck up my eyeliner constantly and I’m v jealous
Way to go hun, mental battles can be the toughest to conquer and it takes a strength not everyone understands. 💪🏼 here’s  to a better tomorrow and and even better day after that :) 💕
Oh man I wish I had your shirt! I love it I bet your a cool dude man keep on going and be strong bud
Aww you cute baby you'll be alright
You have really beautiful eyes. 

Keep up the fight!
You know how sometimes you can just look in someone's eyes, and see intelligence and authenticity? That's what I see when I look at you. I have a boatload of diagnoses myself, and no matter what you feel, I want you to know that it doesn't make you any less of a person. You're young, you have *so much* great shit to look forward to. The dark times provide contrast, and just make the good times that much brighter. I think you have a really rich, fantastic life ahead of you ♥
Lookin good bro
Keep fighting the good fight!! You deserve to be happyyyyy
Major kudos for pushing through! That's never easy, so please know that you are a very strong person. You have lovely eyes and a nice face. Good luck with everything!
Something about your face is so sweet and just utterly loveable.
You have an amazingly cute face, and beautifully unique looks!
I have and still am going through some of my own mental health issues, and I know even to be recovering is an amazing step, as most people do not even seek help in the first place. So long as you are determined, you will be back on track in no time!
Keep up the good work and I hope to see you in a better place very soon!
Great style - love you shirt and hair! Keep fighting it will get easier brother!
GO HARUKEN!!! Sweet shirt dude!
Especially since it looks like you might be in your teens—you have really good skin! How do some people manage to get all the way through adolescence and young adulthood without the curse of pizzaface?? A lot of people you know are probably jealous of you for that, lol. And the messy moptop haircut is totally charming.

I’m fixing breakfast over here and I wish I could sit you down and make you some toast and listen to what you’ve got going on. Do you take butter, marmalade, or both? :P But even from a long way away, I do want to let you know that even if there’s nobody around right now who you’re close enough with to talk things out, you’re still surrounded by people who wish you well and hope for the best for you even if they don’t know you well, because surprisingly enough, that actually is human nature. You can’t feel it when you’re in the midst of a bad time mentally, but there’s there’s human warmth all around you that’ll be there for you to rediscover when you’re ready. Best wishes for things getting better as soon as they can.
I was confused for a moment because you’re really attractive and look like you have your shit together. I definitely know battles with mental illness and there isn’t a harder or more worthwhile fight in this world. You’re not alone.
We know you've got good taste cause of the T-shirt and if you play that as well as you battle your issues you must beat it every time :-). You look like the kind of guy that knows how to treat everyone and I bet your a real asset to your buds
Dope hair and dope shirt. Keep being you. You got this, and we’re so proud.
i won’t give up. thank you!
♥️ much appreciated:)
holy shit thank you 🙏
woot woot!
thank you!
thx :)
You’re still young enough to accomplish so much. Just look forward. Forget about what happened in the past.
1. That's a magnificent beard.
2. Nice mycological decor! Fantastic taste.
3. Careers are fluid, dynamic things with a different path for every individual such that success isn't so easily judged. If you're employed and don't completely hate your job, you're ahead of the curve. If you're employed and completely hate your job... Well, you're both no less than average and have well over more than half of your work life left to make changes.
damn dude thats a great beard. also as a graphic designer, I appreciate the work put in to the card. nice choice on the typeface too, is that courier?
Buddy, you are truly eye-catching! Wowzer!
Life is shitty sometimes... but you have an awesome beard :)

I’m sorry this is a hard time you’re going through. I am sending you all the positive vibes in the world
It’s is literally never too late to realize the things in your life that are going wrong, and to make a change based off that insight. This is a pivot point in your life. From here on in, things get exponentially better. Living with the goal of finding and aligning with authenticity and purpose is so goddamn rewarding. This is your time.
Everyone has a form of insecurity don’t let it ruin your life. Even if you say your degree is useless (maybe it’s not) but I’m sure the experience you got from learning and pushing yourself to get a masters shows your dedication and strength to push on. As for relationships sometimes some people are only suppose to be there a certain part of your journey and relying on someone to not make you feel lonely isn’t the point. Now it’s a time to work on yourself learn new things and push yourself harder and you can do it!
Hey man I bet you're a great friend and tons of fun to chill with. I'm sorry about the relationship, but you're lucky to get to experience a relationship VS. no relationship. Do you have any creative endeavors?
The post office should give your beard its own zip code so it can receive fan mail.
According to the daisy wheel in my typewriter, yes it is 😂
Actually yeah, I do have some creative outlet. I am trying to focus on some of that to keep positive.
Cool hair!
Thanks for your comment :) I love your piercings and earrings! Blue looks good in your hair too!
Opal is the coolest! Also now I want snacks.
You rock!
Blues singer? Thats dope as fuck what do u like to sing?
I've been ghosted a million times. It sucks, but it's part of life. And the truth is, it's their loss, because you are an interesting, multifaceted person who anyone should be happy to know. The most attractive thing a person can have, imo, is passion, and you've definitely got that!
When people ghost you, they are actually doing you the favour of not having to deal with their cowardly asses for any longer than you already have. 

Take your excellent haircut and your cute AF pixie energy and go find someone better.
I love your hair, and I like your whole look. And why do you think you're going to get ghosted? You look like someone who's really cool
God you're adorable!! So pretty and I love your overall style! F that loser who's ghosting you! It's his loss. You're totally a CATCH. 💯
You are a cutie!
I´d love to hear you sing ! Any public audio clips that i could listen to ?
Girl. Next. Door. I would date the absolute fuck out of you.
I really like your hair and your style suits you super well. Just got one thing..... I'm British and you do not toast a teacake because it will melt, but nice analogy
Thanks! You can't really see here but my lip and nose studs are also opals haha
Mostly just do covers of classic stuff, with my own twist if I'm feeling adventurous. You know, Arthur Hamilton, Robert Johnson, Freddie King etc. It won't go anywhere but it makes me happy so :)
None that I know of, maybe one day I'll post to Reddit in some way and see what you guys think :)
I'm also British my friend, and you're thinking of specifically Tunnock's; there are other forms of toastable teacake
Well done nonetheless!
I think thats awesome, u should be proud of your talents
Absolutely ! And as for the ghosting and turning down. Musically i´ve been there several times. On the other hand, those turndowns has made me to improve the "Me" -sound in my tracks.

&#x200B;

You´ll achieve your goal, i´m sure of it !
Ooooh yeah I forgot and I should know it as a poshboi ™ but anyway you have awesome style and I really like your choker
Thank you! And now I know I don't give off an automatic tea-drinkin' scone eatin' English vibe ahahaha :))
You're very welcome and you should take my lack of English recognisation as a compliment because I don't like the English on the most part
Your hair looks so healthy and you have an awesome smile!
I WANNA BE YOUR FRIEND
I love your genuine smile
You look like you give good hugs and I would like one please.
Hey it's Sk8ter Boy.  Nice to see you and your adorable smile here again.  You really are an incredibly talented man and a wonderful companion.  If you'd ever like a friend to talk to, you can always PM me.
You are damn cute
You are cute! Love your hair and smile :)
You look like that friend who come with the best jokes and have demand for you becouse he know exactly what can you do and everything want your good
Love the hair man!!! It’s glorious
Dont know what kind of music you listen to but you give me that "cool-as-fuck-rockstar-reggae-man" vibe
Cool hair!
Beautiful smile! Especially your eyes can really see the joy in them.
GREAT SMILE!!!!
Beachy hot-dad energy.
Your smile made me smile. Also, like, I want your hair.
You really are cute, man!! And that smile! It's just contagious ;) thanks for posting! You've sent us the good vibes 💛
What an awesome smile you have there !
SO CUTE. I thought i remembered seeing your sweet face here before :)
You are cute! Keep smiling internet stranger!
Looks like you floss good.
Glorious hair and very cute face 🖤
You look like a guy that would be a blast to hang out with. Cheers, bro. Keep smiling.
You look like a Rock Star!! 🔥🔥🔥
That smile is like "I'm your best friend" and "I'll buy this time" and "I made you a mixtape" and "I ate the last donut, don't be mad" and "Let's watch Netflix, you can pick the movie" and "Go for it, buddy, I got your back" all rolled up into one.
You look like that good and fun friend that brings joy to a party
You’re cute as heck friend :)
Thanks 😊 I try to keep it nice
I wanna be your friend too
😄
Just one? You can have as many as you want 🤗
Nice to see you too! And likewise here, my DMs are always open to new friends 🙂
Not as cute as you 💕
Thanks 🙂
I'd like to think that I do, but most of my humor is self depreciation and memes so 😂
I'm glad you like it 😊
😊

I listen to lots of things, to include pop-punk, heavy metal/metalcore, kpop, techno, vaporwave, stuff like that. Just depends on my mood really
Thanks 🤙
Thanks, kind person 😄
Thanks for the nice comment 🙂
😎😎
I’m glad I could make you smile too 😊
Awesome! I hope you keep smiling too, kind person 🤗
And I used to feel so self conscious about it too haha
I like to pop in here every now and then since everybody is so sweet and nice 🤗
Will do, kind stranger!
I don't but I should. I kind of neglected self care for a long time, I'm working on it but not trying to overwhelm myself by doing everything at once, if that makes sense
💕💕
And cheers to you! :)
Sometimes I wish I really was one
This is a great toast, thanks 😄 I hope you have a nice day :)
I sure do try to :)
Thanks friend :)
Ballyhoo, 311, chili peppers, tropidelic, pasadena, bumpin uglies; all amazing bands, really reccomend if youre into the pop-punk-rock kinda mood

Jam on, my friend 🤘
No prob! Keep rockin that hairstyle my guy!
I was ready to feel like shit today, but you just made my whole goddamn day :)
Of course I do understand. I'm trying to do one thing at a time too. Last week I painted my room. And that took, what, like 6 months for me? But completion is completion. Cheers to you too.
I will check them out for sure! 🤙
I'm really happy to hear that 😊 I hope you have a lovely day :)
I really like the Hawaiian shirt it’s a really cool and unique addition to your outfit!
Good taste in movies!
You got spit on.  But at least you don't have period blood on your pants!  

Not every day can be a good one but there is always a chance for a brighter tomorrow.   

Show the world your smile. It might just smile back.
2018 was the worst year of my life, despite having experienced horrible traumas in earlier years. The funny thing about life, is that the bad years make you better. They provide a backdrop which you can compare yourself against in the future. Fuck the rest, believe in yourself.
I agree about the shirt! Try not to let the customer get to you. Keep in mind that most people aren’t like that and what he did had more to do with him and his issues than anything you said or did.
A weird way to look at things but some years have got to be the worst so others can be the best. 
Know that you deserve to be treated better at work and maybe look at going somewhere else. 
Even if it’s a really little thing, try to change anything you can in your life at the moment. No matter how small. You still have so much time to turn this year around. Good luck!!
No one should have to go through that. You deserve better
You didn’t deserve that, it’s happened to me as well.  You’ll have much better days. At 19 years old you’re going to have tons of good days ahead.
Customer service sucks... its also been a shitty year for me but we both got this!!! Life sucks sometimes but it is worth it and I believe in you
Your hair is so goddam lush you can barely contain it. Have you been shampooing with the nectar of the gods ?
Keep going. Maybe 2020 will be the best year of your life, cancelling out 2019. Also, don't take   
 what that person did personally. They're just an asshole
What the hell who would do that! No one deserves that, dude! Damn.

Keep you head up high, better and brighter days are ahead of you and I pray they come find you soon!!! Hang in there! You're worthy and you are loved. Just keep going.

PS. You are cute! 😁
customers are assholes im so sorry that fucking sucks but at least you got Superbad lmao. I also like your shirt its very moana vibes
Customers are the worst.... I am so sorry someone did that to you. I really hope your year gets better.  If you ever need a friend or someone to talk to let me know! Otherwise I’ll be sending good vibes your way :) 

Ps I love your taste in Hawaiian shirts :)
I dig the shirt and Jonah Hill in the background. Sorry that people can be monsters. That is assault and NEVER warranted. People can suck, but don't let it get you down.
That customer sounds like a really pathetic person and I’m sorry they brought more negativity in your life. Keep your head up—we’re more than halfway through the year and the bad times don’t last forever. Also, you’re a very attractive guy (this is coming from a female haha), so hey you got that going for you! (:
You look like the best dad for a kid
That would seriously suck, I hope you are doing okay and just remember you have a glorious head of hair that is like a freaking lion's mane (which is awesome).
Focus on making time with the kids as "normal" as possible. Be available, be open. Listen.  You look like someone who has an easy time with that, so keep it. The days are long, but the years are short.
You look hella cute
Sounds like you handled a difficult situation as maturely and gracefully as possible. I hope you'll enjoy the time you spend on yourself now, rediscovering what makes you happy and setting new goals.
The good news at the kids will still be there, and you can still be a major part of their life! You'll get to watch them grow and enjoy a lifelong relationship with them! The flow is great. You pull it off
You look absolutely fucking full of love. It’s beautiful. Never stop spreading it.
Oh they aren’t mine. They’re hers. They started calling me Dad just about a week before she decided to split. I don’t really think I’ll be seeing them again. Whether it’s good or bad, it’s what it is.
Did you get evaluated for autism with post-concussion syndrome? If you did, the neuropsychologist should lose their job. But anyway, you're working hard on seeing the bright side of things. That's why you're asking for a toast. If you can manage that while life is getting you down, you're stronger than most people. You simply don't give yourself enough credit and I would like to remind you that you are an amazing person. You deserve to be happy and you will be happy again soon.
So far I count 3 on this who are have put their (User) names on the petition to change your Conviction. On both counts.

I am married to someone with BPD and a host of other things and she often feels the same way. Sometimes about me. Someone who has been with her for 16 yrs and married for 11. So please know that there is a future. Granted they are not they same (or at least diagnosed properly with the same) issues you are facing but there are people out there who want to change your mind.


You have gorgeous hair, a lovely facial structure and when the smile comes I am sure it is waiting for. Allow yourself to smile. Treat yourself to a warm glow every so often. You have it harder than most so the more often you can tell yourself that you still deserve that chance, the sooner you can lend YOUR voice (internal or out loud), both are valid) to telling yourself you are worthy. Stick around, please.
Hey friend, I have a shitload of diagnoses myself. Disregard that shit. I don't mean don't treat your illness; what I mean is don't let your illness inform who you are. You've got a hard road ahead of you, no denying that,  but if you can live through it, it'll only make you better. Just imagine, a girl like you can become completely invincible. I believe in you 100%.
You are a very beautiful lady!! And despite having these diagnoses or not, you deserve to love yourself and face this with a positive attitude. I know things may not seem great right now, but I truly hope you know that things always seem to come back around.
I think you are attractive and I don't think you should let negatives define you. I know it is hard but try and focus on the parts of you that you like the most. I'm rooting for you!
I'm really sorry you've got so much to deal with. That's a heavy load to bear, and you're doing a damn fine job. You are strong and beautiful and one day you will come to believe it. I know you won't be able to accept this now, but I absolutely know that there are some people for whom "dealing with" you is the high point of their day. Please remember; you have a condition that makes it difficult for you to see things the way others do, and it will keep you blind to the best points about yourself. Please be kind to yourself, because you are absolutely worth it.
You have a beautiful face shape, gorgeous eyes and you also seem to have very pretty long hair! Don’t let a diagnosis be the measurement of your value, you’re much more than that!
Let’s just address the last part of your post first...a lot of women pay a ton of money for Botox treatments in order to have such full lips that you just have naturally.  I would bet that everyone who has ever kissed you will forever measure everyone else’s kiss to yours.  You are amazingly beautiful!  I am not sure I have the right words to say to make you not feel anxiety and depression...however, I would say that you seem so kind, sweet, loyal, and have good character.  A lot of people could use someone just like you in their lives.
Life can be tough, but you're not the only one. I'm on the autism spectrum, with bi-polar disorder and either ADD or ADHD (doctor hasn't decided which yet). My wife has PMDD, PTSD and PCOS. You've got our empathy. And if a schlub like me can find an amazing gal, there's someone out there for you. You are valuable and you are worthy of love and happiness.
You’re adorable. I hope you can get some relief from those things. It may take some time but I know you can do it. I worked with someone on the autism spectrum. He shared that it was a struggle for him growing up, but once he got evaluated and learned to live with it things got a lot better for him. He just got married. I struggle with identity stuff as well. Im working on being kind to myself. Seems strange that it’s such a hard thing to do. Looking up self compassion has been helping me. You’re worth it! Did I mention that you’re really pretty?
You are attractive your eyes are beautiful I wouldn’t be able to stop staring at them if we were talking ❤️
You're beautiful. I've got some labels on myself from diagnoses (bipolar, anxiety, hardcore depression), so I understand the struggle and I definitely understand the "nobody should have to deal with me." But you're a lot more than those diagnoses. I don't want to say a bunch of cliches because they won't help. But you seem very, very lovely and I'm here if you ever need to talk about anything. You may not think they're strong, but you've made it until this moment and that isn't nothing. In fact, it's everything. Take it slowly and realize you've made it this far. Try not to think about the future, just by moments.
You know, with that slew of bad luck you could have given right up, but here you are, taking care of yourself - that speaks really highly of you, that in such a dark place you could reach out.

Also, FYI, objectively you have a wonderful face structure, so you don't need to worry about that. Sure, in this picture you're not glammed up - but that doesn't mean your natural form isn't showing through.

Some good points for you to focus on - let me break down why you don't need to worry about looks:

- Thick, strong hair in a lovely honey colour. 
- Well shaped eyebrows
- Almond shaped eyes that are gorgeously dark and expressive
- Well shaped, straight nose that fits your facial structure
- Full lips people would pay for
- Danity jawline and elegant cheek bones
You're carrying a heavy burden BUT:

\-you are a valuable human being, even if you're facing more challenges than the average person doesn't mean you're less worthy. It makes you a badass and I'm sure you have a lot to bring to the world. Also, you are loved more than you can possibly imagine.

\-less importantly: you are very pretty :) you do not see yourself as we do, you are a beautiful young woman and you should be proud!
You tried well. The light is just beginning to shine on your face again.
You have a beautiful face which does not belong in the dark.🤗
Sometimes life can be unfair.  I dealt with mental issues of my own for a few years and I can tell you it does get better. 

You're a beautiful lady and you have so much to offer the world.  Being diagnosed with something does not mean the end of the line. In fact some of the most influential people in history showed signs on autism and other mental disorders.  
You define who you are, not a piece of paper.  

In a world where social media favours "perfect" people. We need more imperfection, the beauty of life and not of false image. 

Stay strong and be positive.  You're worth every atom!
First, you're not a diagnostic. You're a person.

And I know these things make everything so hard to deal with, but when you say "I feel that no one should have to deal with you", I felt that. Because that's what I thought for a long time. Thing is, even if I hated myself for a long time, I found people that really love me for who I am. I didn't understand, hell, I still don't understand it sometimes. But like my therapist said, "people can like you for no apparent reason (at least reasons you can't understand), whether you like it or not". I'm sure people like / will like you because you're an amazing person, that deserves the fucking world. 

Also, you're really attractive, and well, I just hoped you could see it!
When you find that person it isn't a matter of "dealing with you". Everyday is worth it. Both my gf and I have our own issues and insecurities about "putting" them on eachother. Everything about her is what makes her beautiful. Am I against her seeking help, no, but I'm also not going to give up because some days are hard. It's small steps everyday. The little things you are able to accomplish make the biggest difference. Making your bed, brushing your teeth or hair. Say something positive to yourself everyday if possible. You have a bigger impact on someone's life than you know and everyday is the chance to do that again.

  


P.s. you're beautiful
You are super cute.
You are so beautiful and have a charming quality about you, im not the best with words but despite your diagnoses youre deserving of care and love
i love you! youre a strong beautiful human with lots of great potential
Your beatiful inside and out
You are here with us. You’ve gotten help to sort thru your difficulties. You have strength and will get stronger as you harness these dragons. Everyone that wants to improve their life deserves help and love. You deserve it. And yes you are attractive. Lovely eyes and that brave smile- long pretty hair... yes. You are attractive. This is hard but you are taking the climb to a good life. It will come in time. This world needs you bc you are here. Some day you will find out your reason for being brought to life.
Hey there. I'm also autistic, and I also have a lot of mental health issues. I'm here for you if you need anything. And you deserve all the love in the world. Don't let anyone convince you otherwise. I hope things get better soon.
Whenever I try to cheer my friends up, i am always shy of words, because whatever I say, it will seem hollow and cliche.   


Instead, as someone that has been sick for more than 15 years (with different issues, granted) I am convinced we are more than any labels we collect along the way. We should not identify with those, we are more than that. They are just here so other people can help us.   


But you are not just those labels, you are a lovely woman that has her own passions and is more than the sum.   
Just like me. And I would love it if you could reply to me and tell me what interests you.   
That is what I would love to learn about you and I hope you can tell me.   


Me personally, I have been struggling with Chronic fatigue syndrome and a couple of months ago, some people suggested to me to look into possible autism as a source of extra fatigue. In a few hours, I have my last appointment in the diagnostic track and it is very likely that the result is indeterminable. (Due to the lack of information from my youth.) But that is only a small part of me, I love playing board games and whenever I have enough energy I will try to play a game with friends. And when am bedridden, I love to listen to fantasy novels.   


What do you love to do?   


Besides that, I do want to reaffirm what other people have written, you are a beautiful woman. I can see the pain in your eyes, but despite that, your beauty still shines through!
I don't know what it is, but you have a very comforting face. I look at it and feel at peace. Things may be bleak right now, but I haven't heard of a single person whose life sucked all the way through. Keep your chin up and smile! If no one else does, I've got your back!
Girlllllll, you’re gorgeous!!!!
It’s harder to be yourself than it is to be anyone else, isn’t it? I live with DID, plus I had the amazingly awful benefit of devoting myself to studying identity before leaving academia. That was before I found out though. 

Thing is, now that you know and have all these labels, these boxes, you now have an opportunity to be formless. You can be in the box when you need to be, but your real existence is the time where you move between the boxes. The path is the point, and your path brought you here where you might now be reading this. 

Boxes are hard, stubborn things that can’t feel. People are weird creatures who don’t stop being bizarre, emotional and contradictory. But it’s okay because you are aware. That awareness is not so prevalent, and I applaud you on it. 

Do you like reading? If so there’s a couple pretty great books on psychological trauma I could recommend, plus a few subs on here that might be helpful. 

I hope you’re doing well and remembering to breathe easy and hang loose.
u/hiddenmutant

I'm not going to dive in to all of the other stuff because people have already discussed it, but I just wanted to let you know that you are beautiful. I'm not trying to make you feel better by saying that, it's just the truth. You need to know that you are definitely way more attractive than you give yourself credit for. Keep being you and don't let any of your issues weigh you down, ESPECIALLY any insecurities about your looks. You're very pretty and you just need to accept that :)
Be gentle with yourself, nobody (literally nobody) is so deeply flawed that they don't deserve love and compassion.
You look adorable
I have 80% of the issues you just mentioned, none of those disorders would stop me from dating someone that is struggling with the issues you just mentioned.

Ohh and everybody else is correct you are extremely attractive.
I saw your picture first before i read and the first thing I thought was wow she’s really pretty. 

Also, just remember darling, you are always worthy of love and care. Don’t forget that.

Edit: Some syntax issues lol
I hope you have a toasty day, and get out of the flunk, having a medical issue it is hard to live life some times, how ever you must find ways to press on and continue with daily life.  It takes a special some one to want to date certain people, You will have to keep looking until you find that special some one.  good luck
You are cute af , don't know what you are trying to talk about with your attractivness but I would 100% date you :)
You’re SO cute! And none of those diagnoses define you. ❤️
Idk why but when I saw your picture it made me smile. You look like a really kind, sweet, and caring person. And actually you are cute. Honestly you should be proud of yourself for what you have accomplished. It might not seem like much, but I know people that have less health issues than you do and never leave their bed. You're awesome really.
Your smile, although it may be forced and perhaps feels wrong to you given your situation, is absolutely beautiful; and the fact that you at least attempted a smile says more than you know about your ability to overcome your hardships. I believe in you <3
Actually, you look great. Your depression is causing you to see yourself as lesser than who you are. Trust me that looks are not your problem. And you are certainly not a burden, you are a gift to the world in your own unique way. Some of us have to deal with bigger mental baggage than others, and in the end you will only be stronger and more resilient for it. 

You’ll get through the worst of this, you should believe in and hope for a brighter future, because you have more going for you than you realize, and nothing in your mind will define how likable, valuable, or how attractive you actually are. 

As someone who deals with DP/DR, anxiety and depression, keep searching for the bright side in things, because you will find it in yourself to find that brighter tomorrow, especially if you keep smiling :)
You will be okay, you have the kindest eyes. My sister has some overlapping diagnoses with you and I love that little munchkin with all my heart, so even if you don't feel it, there are people who are capable of loving you.
Girl, you look like an amazingly nice person! I bet, if we had ever met in person, we would have been friends immediately. Because I pick my friends by kindness and good heart. And you not only shine from the inside, you also have this really sympathic look. Like a little angel. Stay true to yourself. You are amazing! Amazing special edition ❤️
All I have to say is, wow. You've got to have a soul forged in fucking steel. All that, and you still fight, still keep kicking? You're fucking awesome. And cute to boot. Go you, man. I definitely believe in you.
You really have a lot on your plate ma'am, so if anybody deserves to be afforded leeway, it's you.  You're not unattractive, boring, or a nuisance in any way, shape or form.  You ma'am are a beautiful woman and more importantly intelligent, deliberative, and full of intrigue.  I feel like we could have long, introspective conversations in which we ponder esoteric topics like quantum mechanics, cosmology, the meaning of life, etc.  Very few people can offer such stimulating conversation and for that you should be immensely proud.  It would be such a rare gift and a privilege to call you a friend.  If you would ever like a friend to talk to, my PMs are open.
> I’m not even attractive to help my case.

You're kidding me right? I'd be lucky to have a girl as pretty as you talk to me, let alone hanging on my arm.

Quit saying nonsense like that!

Real talk: Just because you don't look like a model, doesn't mean you aren't attractive.
You’re beautiful. Very attractive. You look like a very interesting and intelligent person. I could totally stalk you. 

Don’t let these times define you. Don’t let your past define you. Live in the moment and define yourself. You will get through these times. It may change you, you may never be the same, but that’s what life is all about. I hope you find happiness within yourself. Learn to love yourself for who you are and not want to be someone else.   Everyone else is dumb anyway. Eventually you will meet someone who sees you for how you see yourself.
I don’t comment a lot to be honest but I think you’re pretty asf.. I logged in just to comment I hope everything goes well for you I’m wishing you the best of luck
I want to deal with you. You’re also beautiful, and so brave. Keep trying to smile. <3
You remind me a little of Emilia Clarke tbh. You're really cute c:
No, they were due to separate (though a little overlapping) symptoms.  Post-concussion syndrome was last August, and is mostly in my frontal lobe (I have terrible memory problems), but is generalized throughout my entire brain (getting into the cause would require a lot of setup which I don’t think anyone cares to read through).

I was just evaluated earlier this month for autism by a separate professional I’m seeing closer to where I live (PCS doctor is in another state), stemming mostly from my difficulty with socializing and understanding others.  I have very few friends and struggle with making them.

I appreciate your words, though.  I don’t believe that I’m a strong person, but maybe one day I can be if I can make it through this.
I guess I don’t even know who I am.  Most of myself is made up to be around other people, because people actively don’t want to be around me if I’m actually being pretty uninhibited with my “personality.”  Not that I become rude or mean at all, just that I say a lot of the wrong things I think and talk too much about things no one else cares about.  I feel like the worst combination of clueless and boring.

I just feel like I’m not worth it to the world, to anyone, or even to myself.  I’m trying to be better, but I still feel pathetic.
I like most board games too, but I’m also really into magic the gathering.  I know the players get a bad rap, but the community where I live is actually quite supportive.  It’s really hard for me to find people who will play with me though, and I’m honestly not that good at making decks so I usually get stomped on.

I really enjoy a lot of forms of art too.  I used to produce a lot more, but more and more it’s really hard for me to sit down and get into a piece sadly.
I actually have a friend who bears a very close resemblance to her, haha.
Former boxer, here... Good and balanced nutrition, and staying hydrated whilst allotting for ample sleep are the only way to heal the brain IMO.
Let me give you a clue I wish I was given: those functional, successful, attractive adults? They have no clue who the fuck they are either. You've got a leg up knowing your own weaknesses. Embrace yourself, you've got so many more challenges and yet you're still alive.
Can I just say that you’re doing great and I’m proud of you. The fact that you’re brave enough to open up about this is just amazing.

I know things are difficult now but don’t let all that define you. You’re a wonderful person, we’ve all got things to work on so just take your time
I talk too much about things that others don't think of as important too, it doesn't matter if they think it's not important because it's just like food, people have different tastes and like some things a lot more than others, as long as it's important to you it's important.
I got the most societal approval when I was Not handling my issues well. Other people aren’t always a good barometer with how well you are doing. Sometimes the better at dealing with our own issues we get the more resistance we get from other people. 

The deep down feeling we aren’t good enough is fictional. Why is it when we are depressed we behave as though we have the most insight into who we really are ?

When it’s the reverse that is true.
I can relate so much <3 All of my pre-adult life was spent trying to fit in. Then one day I started studying physics and then I realized I was finally with my peers: socially awkward to different levels, nerdy, etc. We were a bunch of misfits and we accepted each others. 

Bottom line: you're at an age where everyone is figuring out their identities. It's hard for everyone, but especially for those of us who don't fit the mould. Please hang in there and believe me, it gets better. Stick to your interests, believe in yourself. You deserve to be heard as much as everyone else. Reach out to those who support you (online friends count!) and practise compassion towards yourself. Treat yourself as a friend, this is the most important thing in the world. Big hugs <3
Well, if you ever feel like playing a board game on tabletop simulator, please let me and we'll give it a go! :)

I haven't played magic in ages, but luckily it is not about winning too much, but about having fun while playing. :) And in terms of playing, have you been to local board game stores? They might know places where players get together regularly. If you'd tell me the place you live in PM, I can help you look for a place. ^^

And I know what you mean by things getting harder. Just don't give it up completely, just do it when you feel like it and don't force yourself too much. There is no problem with stepping away and returning to it when you feel better. I do this as well when painting miniatures. Sometimes I do not advance for days. Sometimes all that happens when I do, is a couple of licks of paint than feel overwhelmed. There is no shame in stepping away and returning later. As long as you enjoy yourself when doing the task. 

Are you feeling better today? Is the PMDD more manageable? Or should we try and help you smile a bit more? ^^
I’m good about everything but the sleep part, I have really terrible insomnia.  Warm showers before bed, working out regularly, keeping phone down, meditation, all sorts of sleep aids, nothing ever keeps me asleep the whole night.  I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s one of my leading causes of a lot of symptoms.
Same. I hate to say it but self-medicating w/ Benadryl and staying completely sober is the only thing that keeps me sane. It does require a little bit of adulting, bc if you abuse it; it’ll give you a nasty headache. Also it’s not great for your skin.
Yo, I'm a huge non-starter. But I think I'm a bit older than you (early 30's). You know what really matters? Experience. Connection. Art. Does material wealth or superficial accomplishment matter, sifted through the sands of time? Fuck no. I bet you're funny, fun, and overall rad af. Don't be afraid to take the left-hand path.
There's no timeline to success. You're still young enough to do whatever the hell you want. The hair is bold and creative. I couldn't pull it off, but you sure can
I've come to realize that it is best to not compare yourself to others. A lot of my friends are doing much "better" than me in life. Engagements, promotions, vacations, etc. I used to get upset and wonder why I was the way I was. Recently it sort of clicked that the reasons I "want" those things is because I want to keep up with them not  because I truly want them. This simple realization triggered a huge change in my mindset. Life isn't perfect but it just feels good to know what I want and to have no fear about missing out or whatever.  Life is a crazy experience and as far as I can see we only get one go so I'm gonna do it my way. Some people might think I'm lazy or not motivated but the truth is I am motivated - just not by money or fancy things.


Anyways you seem cool and I just wanted to kind of share how I've been feeling lately. I hope it wasn't to much of a ramble and maybe it can resonate with you a bit.

Much love
Hey man...I've been in shoes similar to yours, and I know its impossible to see from where you are, but The Wheel turns always and conditions change.

Hang tight! I "blossomed late"...way late and it was perfect. You cant rush perfect! Best you dont compare yourself to others, because even the wildly successful get miserable when they do that.
Don’t compare yourself to others!! They might look like on surface level that they have it together but there’s always something under the surface they are struggling with. Everyone has their thing, don’t feel bad about yourself based on the way other people are living.
Ps. I love your hair!
Those are things that I really appreciate. It's pretty fun to make cool stuff and make friends doing it. Maybe I should be focusing more on that. You seem pretty fucking rad yourself. Thanks :) for commenting and for your perspective.
Thanks. Even when I'm not sure what direction I'm going I do like my hair :)
This was really helpful. It's hard not to compare but you're right I should focus down on what I really want. I didn't really think making this post would be so useful but it's really getting me thinking. Thanks.

Much love back at you
This is so poetically put. I'll keep on hanging, hopefully I'll bloom soon. :) thanks man. I really appreciate it
You're right, I shouldn't compare but it's a little difficult. Maybe it'll encourage me to do some new things. I'll keep in mind to be slightly nicer to myself. And thank you, my hair makes me feel better
Glad to help in any way I can. Feel free to send me a pm if you ever want to shoot the shit. Also forgot to mention that your hair is badass.
I'm happy that you have a friend like that. I'm in a similar situation where it's been 2 months since I've seen my closest friend. I bet she thinks the same about you
The glasses make you look great
I experience extreme anxiety, coupled with loneliness and isolation. *But that doesn't mean you're bad.* let me tell you something that took me ages to realize- your self image is not the same as other's image of you. I bet there are lots of people who would love to get to know you. I know I would.
Wow you are beyond beautiful. Hugs hope you start feeling better
“Like nobody really cares” I bet that’s not true.
OH WOW! YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL!!! SO BEAUTIFUL. BELIEVE YOU ME. 💛
That has to be typed all caps as I was really stunned by your face when I scrolled through your post! And that smile- breathtaking! 💯
Your eyes are hypnotizing and that smile just makes it easier to be dazed
Your eyes are GORGEOUS! I also love your hair color on you! It REALLY suits you!
Damn! Are you even wearing make up? It looks like you are not and your eye color is stunning! It is said that the eyes are the gate to the soul. Yours seems to be very deep and wise. Maybe your soul is telling you something that you are not aware of yet. Sometimes we are stuck in situations that we think are normal but don’t feel good to our soul. It’s a warning. Observe when these anxiety situations hit you. I know what I am talking about as I was, 4 years back from now, waking up at night, feeling anxious to fall asleep because I thought my heart would stop. Months later I realized those were anxiety attacks. I literally stopped breathing and woke up from it. Looking back it only happened when I was lying next to my partner. The relationship turned out to be toxic. The break up freed me from those attacks. You look like you are a strong person. So, stop holding your fears back and stop bottling them up and be brave enough to face them (or better face what causes them and tackling it full front). I know you can do it! ❤️
Hi mate. Soooo many people have anxiety and depression and go onto bigger and better things. I understand that it is lonely and isolating on occassions but lemme tell you that you are not alone. There are thousands of people sharing the same feelings as you right now so even though you are in rough seas others are right there paddling alongside you. You wilk get through it.

Clear your mind with exercise and try meditation, be honest with yourself and seek help. Start working on your life.

You are doing great. All the best friend.
Thank you so much for your kind words. I appreciate it so much!
Thank you so much!
Thank you!!
Thank you so much! That means a lot!
Thank you😭😭 I appreciate it!!
You're welcome 🌝
You deserve kindness no matter how much you feel you don't. There is never a wrong time to show compassion to yourself or others❤️
Sorry that you’re struggling, try to remember that you’re worth should have nothing to do with your appearance, you seem really friendly and kind. You also have amazing eyes as I’m sure you get told often:)
You've got amazing eyes! It wouldn't have occurred to me to think you were tired if you hadn't mentioned it. And try not to let those negative voices have too much say. You're way better and stronger than you think you are. It's much easier for you to see your flaws and imperfections than it is for you to see other people's, but I guarantee you that they're there. Remember - you are a child of the universe and have a right to be here. You're awesome, and whatever you do, you'll do a great job.
You are super beautiful. Hugs. Think of the sing just be happy by dory from finding nemo, I believe.
Two things that hopefully help out.  I used to be tired all of the time a long time ago, and then I learned that it's not really how much sleep you get that can change this, but the day-to-day *quality* of your sleep.  

Once I started a regular exercise routine and stayed with it, I never had more energy in my life.  That's because even an average lighter-impact three-day-a-week routine wears your body down just enough in order to get the greatest sleep possible.  Trust me, I've never gotten better sleep or had more energy in my life until I learned about that.  It can also drastically improve your overall mood as well, but the 'brain science' behind it all is beyond my abilities to explain in a nutshell.

And here's a little clip that I hold dear and think about whenever start heading in the direction of negative self talk that I hope you enjoy too:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BjKS1-vjPs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BjKS1-vjPs)
When you deal with negative self-talk, think of it this way: Would you talk to someone else like that? Give yourself the kindness you would give someone else. You got this.
Jesus you're gorgeous, I'm amazed lol
Try to remember then you have family and friend's with you and thinking you are a better person then you think 
You look very beautiful and friendly like a friend who laught with you all day but when you have a problem he come first to help you
If you need to talk or vent your more than welcome to message me I would love to hear you out and learn new things and who knows maybe I can give advice or help in anyway
Mind sharing some of that negative self-talk so you can have it refuted by an external source?
You have absolutely gorgeous eyes! Also, try looking in the mirror and saying at least one good thing about yourself every morning. It really helps boost self esteem.
X2
Agreed so fully to all above, and remember too, your first word there was ‘tired.’ Things suck more when tired, get some goooood soulful rest sister!
Thank you
Hey there, it’s your Uncle Ben here. Just wanted to let you know that I’m proud of you for having the courage to post this picture without censoring it.
You definitely don't look like a girl. Everyone goes through puberty differently. When your testosterone really starts being produced you'll look older. Give it a few years. Some of my friends started puberty late at age 16-17 and they're very manly looking now.

You have great hair btw.
Hey dude, you look great! Better than I did at the same age, that's for sure. You're still growing into your body and I don't have any doubts that you're going to be a damn fine gent. You've got great lips and expressive eyebrows and I think you might find that both of those stand you in very good stead in the future!
When I was your age, I was a punk with a bright pink and purple mohawk. Seriously dude, I know your self image may be suffering, but I bet you have a stellar personality. That's what matters. And I know this may sound harsh, but the opinions of your peers are *completely* inconsequential. Focus on being the best "you" you can be, and everything will fall into place. Promise.
Hey dude embrace your appearance and changing body! We all go through it, plus you look totally fine! You’ll get used to your appearance the more and more you expose yourself to your appearance/normalize how you look. 

You look great as you are, plus you have a really nice haircut! Keep your head up! Puberty sucks and really effects your perspective of yourself but take solace in the fact that you’re hitting it better than I did!
You’ve got some great lips! Take pride in that, it’s a rare quality in men.
Dude, you look like a 14 year old boy. I have seen guys in their 20s that look like you so don't worry about looking young or like a girl because you don't. Honestly, I see no reason why you should censor your pictures.
It's pretty funny for me to look at your picture, because your face looks almost the same as mine a few years ago. I'm nineteen now and I feel much better with my appearance. 
Your body is going through puberty right now. Although I don't think you look that young, if you do, I can say that you will look completely different in a year or two. 

You got stunning eyes by the way, almost piercing but not in a bad way!
Actually thought you were like, 16-17. Also, you don't look feminine at all! You definitely look better than me!
You look a ton like a young chris ulmer!
You look like 3 other guys (18, actually) I know that shop at my store and I thought this was a picture of one of them at first glance. Don’t sweat it brother, you’re absolutely masculine!!
People everytime want to mock you because they are gelouse and they are feeling week in front of you. You need to think you are perfect right now you are
I wish someone told me at 14 that I was better than I thought I was. More attractive, more on target for how I want to live, who I want to be... You’ve already got it, all you gotta do is own it. Relentlessly own it.
Thanks, uncle Ben! BTW, next family christmas it at your house, right?
Thank you! >.<

I had some people getting confused about my gender before, but now that I think about it, I guess it is just 'cause I am more cute-looking.

Also, thanks for the compliment about my hair! I already tried some different styles and I decided to stay with this one (Short on one side and a little longer on the other side). My inspiration was Skrillex. XD
Aaaaw! Thanks a LOT, mate! I never liked my eyebrows, but you're making me feel better about it, now. Again, thanks a lot! :D
Yo, you at least weren't insecure and went for a style that stands out. I always wanted to dye a part of my hair purple but I am too insecure.

And thanks a lot, I don't even know what to say, your toasting is next-level!
Aww, thanks! Y'all are making me feel better 'bout myself, I don't even know what to say!
tnx :) A lot of ppl are complimenting my lips, now I am looking at me in a different way.
That's good to ~~hear~~ read, thanks a lot!
Awww! Thanks! People always compliment my eyelashes but never something 'bout the actual eyes. :D
Wait, really? Wow, this is really cool for me! I always did think that all my friends look older and I'm the only one who doesn't but now you boosted me with confidence! Tnx!
You think so? Welp, maybe if his hair was black...
Whoa! Thank you!
Whoa, never tought 'bout that! Thanks a lot!
Absolutely! My nephew Peter’s helping me cook some of my famous rice!
I have pretty soft features myself, hit puberty late, and couldn't grow a beard until I was a 30 year old father of two.

Don't sweat it. You're a good looking kid.
I think you would look great with purple hair, my dude.
That’s great! That’s what this sub is for! A little positivity can go a long way!
I’m glad to hear it.
Serious as a hand grenade bro! I'm glad I could brighten things!
No problem
Nice!
Awww now THERE'S the smile we love to see on here. It's glowing! . That's great to hear, K. The guy is obvs being well behaved so have the confidence he is trying to treat you right.

Good luck for Wednesday! Remember, you are fabulous anyway but hoping it goes the way you want!
You look like 25!
Absolutely amazing!
37?you look like at least 24 girl!!
37? really? are you sure? you look at the most 27.

&#x200B;

you're really pretty. wishing you the best of luck on wednesday (not that you need it!)
Well for starters you accidentally hit "3" instead of "2".
Here's a signal that will always work for someone who looks like you:

"Shut up and kiss me."
Congratulations! He's probably  nervous because you have beautiful soul piercing eyes and a gorgeous smile, you know how sometimes you look at a person and just instantly know they're a good soul? Well that's you, best of luck to you on Wednesday keep up updated we'll be cheering for you!
Wow thats great! Im so happy for you! yea you seem to like each other so just be yourself and I think everything is going to be great!

Good luck! :) :) :)
Between the Beautiful eyes and gorgeous smile, he is probably nervous but ready. Go for it.
That’s an exciting development! Best of luck to you!
You look so happy! It's brightened up my day just seeing it. I wish you the very best. Oh, and I hope you make the first move. I've heard that some shyer guys find that absolutely mind-blowing.
Go with the “so are you going to kiss me yet?”
First of all I can not believe you are 37! Secondly just go for it! You'll probably blow this guy away!
You have super nice skin! Coming from a guy, he could be much more nervous than you would come to think. Sometime it's nice to hear the girl say "shut up and kiss me already". Good luck!
Nice!  Congrats!
You got this!!
20 seconds of courage is all you need! Also your smile is radiant!
Wow, you are radiant! He's very lucky to be going out with you, and to have your eye. Enjoy yourself on Wednesday and don't worry, he -wants- to kiss you, just just might be too intimidated by your beauty to make the first move, or he's just very well behaved.
You look lovely. Lucky guy.
That's one lucky guy!!!
Hell yeah! You look beautiful and youve got this!!!
You're a cutie and look like a sweetheart. I'm sure he likes you if you're on a third date. Just go for it yourself, he's probably just shy. I just started dating someone and was glad she made the first move or I'd definitely be like this guy and still wondering if it's okay to kiss her yet. Good luck!
You look great.
If you like him...go for it. His reaction will be genuine since he won't expect it. Make that move.
37? More like 27! :D I’m sure it’ll all go well, and definitely don’t be afraid to make the first move if you want to :)
Your smile is so heartwarming and lovely! You seem like such a kind and lovely person to be around. I don’t you have anything to be nervous about hun!
KISS HIM! HE'S PROBABLY JUST SHY AND NERVOUS BECAUSE YOU'RE SO PRETTY
Good on you!   


Chances are very likely he is just as nervous as you. You already have the 3rd date planned, feel confidence in that, he at the very least finds you interesting enough to keep coming back for more.   


Follow your heart and everything will turn out alright!  


And as everyone says, you look amazing, just smile and the world will be at your feet. :)
You are absolutely stunning
You’re a beautiful girl. Just flash that smile and that should be all the signals he needs. 😊
Maybe he doesn’t even need a kiss. I’m with a guy who appreciates me no matter what, and you’re absolutely stunning so I don’t know how he couldn’t see it. I’m in Toledo Ohio, if you ever want wanna talk about school ❤️
27M here and I honestly assumed you were my age until I read your caption. Don’t be afraid, go get him!
Ok.. I know it’s an odd detail to get stuck on, but your eyebrows are an amazing color. Like a sunrise or something! Truly beautiful!

Congratulations on the dates. Keep smiling, hold your head up. You’ve got this. Just be you- it’s obvious that you’re a fantastic person.
You got this!!
As someone who thought they were sending obvious signals but according to friends was not, don’t send signals.  If you want to kiss him, ask!  With a smile as gorgeous as yours, and as much as he seems to like spending time with you there shouldn’t be any problems.
You are pretty nice looking, and seem to be a super nice person, don't worry, the guy is almost certainly super into you, just go for it
When you hang out suggest watching The Little Mermaid, and when Kiss the Girl comes on give him a very meaningful. Even outside of my extreme I say go for it, you look like a lovely individual and I'm sure he'd enjoy :)
Very pretty best wishes on your third date 👍
Everyone here talks about some amazing smile? Never got that far in the image, Im still stuck looking into those eyes <3 Just wow !
You remind me of Kira the Gelfling, which is a massive compliment by the way!
Wow your eyes are like.......wooaah. A guy could get lost in them. Like travelling through space at warp speed in the millennium falcon. Eh, total nerd talk, I know. You should have no problem making the first move, OP. I bet since your last date he's been playing it out in his mind the entire time anyway. Save him the torment, show him you know what's up and lean in first.
Don’t be scared to go in for that kiss yourself :) Have a great time regardless
Your hair is absolutely stunning and the colour goes well with the colour of your eyes. And you look like you're in your twenties!
Good luck!! =)
You have a very kind smile!
Wooooow! He is really lucky to date you. You look like you are really a cute girl! Don’t be afraid to rock the boat here or there. You are awesome the way you are.
He's too memorized by those eyes to go in for the kiss. You may need to blink more to help him out.
24M and thought you were younger than me
IIIII don’t think you need any help. You just show up.
Gag him down already!
You got this, but why don't you kiss him first? Why do you have to signal him to kiss you?
Okay, this is gonna sound half-mean and I'm sorry, but if your nostrils were a little smaller, you'd be a definite 10

&#x200B;

Edit: 37?? damn
Hell yeah! Listen. With those eyes and that hair, you don't have a thing to worry about. Laugh and smile and love life, and everything will come naturally. You've got this. We're here for you. 😁
If he doesn’t wanna kiss you, I will! 😂😂😂. Seriously though, you look amazing.  As someone who gets told I don’t look ** years old there’s no way you are almost my age! 26 at tops!
just kiss him, he wouldn't care
Can confirm. My first kiss went exactly like that
mesmerized. come on, Ken
you’re very beautiful, you have a nice face and nice hair, and from what I hear you’re a pretty great person too. Keep it goin bud.
You’re a real cutie! I love your hair colour and style, you have a really nice aesthetic.
Hi there!
I'm glad I got here in time then 😉 
Loving the hair and glasses- epic style...
But more importantly- your smile has the potential to show people the sun still shines, and maybe their smile in return will remind you the same. There's a goodness in you, revel in showing that!
You're very pretty, very nice smile and hair, you kinda look like Maisie Williams but with a prettier smile :)
You pull off blue hair really, really well! :)
You have such a genuinely sweet face. You look like someone I could be close friends with.
You look amazing and I love your hair!! Be kind to yourself man!
you're all so sweet and I want to reply to everyone but I don't know what to say other than thank you, and don't want to be repetitive aaa
You’re so pretty! Your eyebrows are perfect and your hair and glasses suit you so well:) you seem really friendly and relaxed! And you’re dog is adorable btw, kind of reminds me of mine:)
You’re adorable and look very well put together (idk if that makes sense). I love the way everything about you just seems to match and I really hope you don’t delete this because it’s great ❤️
I love love love love your hair! My hair is currently purple and I’m wanting to dye it the color you have it! It’s so flattering on you! I also like your glasses! You seem to have great tastes :) I hope you’re doing well!
You look great, also your hair is amazing. The blue color suits you so well, I love it :)
You have such a sweet smile!!
But you are so cute tho ❤️ blue hair looks so good on you and I love the simple makeup look 💞 such a cutie
Uhm, HELLO BEAUTIFUL! I love your hair! And your glasses! And that button down goes so well with your hair! Your aesthetic is wonderful. We all get insecure sometimes. You’re not alone! 💙
You look beautiful, absolutely love your hair! And you have such a wonderful smile to 😄😁
Such a great username!
If your hair was reddish, you would be a dead ringer for Maisie Williams, only cuter.
You are so pretty! The hair is such a good look on you! I actually think we look kinda similar, but you can definitely rock pale skin and glasses better than I do!
Your blue hair is so chic!
In case no one told you before - You look like Maisie Williams. 

&#x200B;

I'm not even kidding! [Image](https://imgur.com/a/mLPatDj)
Love your hair!
I love your eyebrows and shirt !! 
Those glasses too!! You seem like a girl I’d try and be friends with IRL.  
I hope you have a lovely day ☺️
❤️
Insecure? Not often we see someone with a total true sense of style. Just put that out there with your show stopping smile. You will truly transform people’s moods and make their day- whether they say something or not.
You have an adorable smile.

Your eyebrow game is *strong*.

I like the colour of your hair.
Keep it, it's a really flattering pic
Forever wishing I had eyebrows like yours 😍
I fricking love your hair!
Best user name in all of reddit op
from your hair and eyebrows and makeup i can tell you put a lot of effort into your appearance, and its paying off because you look like a very cool and interesting person and if i saw you in public i’d want to be your friend
Hey beautiful you don’t need to delete anything. Your smile killed each and everyone of us. You are breathtaking
Your eyebrows are great and you have a kind face. 💜
You have a very pretty smile and I love your hair!
Brow game killing it
You are beautiful. I know it can be hard leaving photo up but it is a step forward when you do. Hugs hope all goes well
Your style is amazing; the blouse hair combo snap, crackles and pops. Not to mention you have the cutest face.

Beyond that though your love for Tank is amazing, what a lucky dog to have someone like you that loves them so much.
I am loving your style and especially your hair! You are rocking that look so well. Side question: how do you get your lashes to look so incredible?
Hey you look really nice. I like the smile on you lips. But this haircolour it's awesome. I wish I had the straight to change my haircolour. 
I wish you a good day (hopefully your day just starts because mine ends in a few minutes) what I want to say is that I wish you a great time. Make the best out of every moment.
You are so stunning. I hope you have a great week <3
you are absolutely precious wtf!!!! -heart eyes-
You look like the kind of girl who would make a great friend. (I’m a fairly straight girl, so I usually evaluate girls based on whether I think they’d make a good friend.) You just look so kind and pretty and smart. You look like the type of girl I would confidently set my male friends up with.
You have the cutest hair I’ve ever seen, it complements your face so well! Keep rocking girl, you’re beautiful
There's no reason at all to be insecure when you're gorgeous. Your smile is radiant, your hair looks amazing, and you have a wonderful complexion. You are the epitome of feminine beauty. Don't let your inner demons get the best of you, and have a wonderful day!
You’re so gorgeous! You look like Maisie Williams!
Your smile makes me smile.
I love your hair it’s so pretty! That blue looks good on you!
You’re so cute!!
You are ROCKING that blue hair. I am so jealous!! Very creative and very cute :) You rock!!
You look a lot like Arya from GoT
ur hairs my new fave colour and your username is the best
Your picture simply makes me feel happy.
The hair is absolutely gorgeous, but the true gem here is your smile. You made me smile just by making me look at this picture.
You have a wonderful smile and I love your glasses. You look very cute!
You look like Arya Stark of Winterfell.
That hair is aewsome
Ok, I have a lot to say so I’m just gonna go for it: Ok, so first of all you are amazing at colour coordinating. Your skin tone, hair colour, top, and lip colour all go together PERFECTLY. Btw, if you’re wearing a lip product - what is it?? I love it! You have such a gorgeous lip shape and eye shape (ngl I’m jealous) and you apply makeup really nicely!! I also love your cheeks, they make me happy! You seem like someone I would want to approach and be friends with. Lastly, YOUR HAIR. Oh my gOD I gasped. It’s amazing! It reminds me mostly of a soap by Lush called “[Outback Mate](https://www.lush.ca/en/shower/bar-soap/outback-mate/06057.html)” that I always love seeing because I think it’s so cool looking and beautiful. Also, the “[Sea Vegetable](https://www.lush.ca/en/shower/bar-soap/sea-vegetable/00079.html)” one, but moreso the first one. Additionally, it reminded me of Owl City’s “The Midsummer Station” album, which surprised me as thinking about it now, the “Ocean Eyes” is probably closer colour wise. Anyways, I’m super jealous !! You have a perfect gradient going on and strong colour payoff. I hope you have a great day and feel better soon !!!
Your hair looks really good! Did you do it yourself or professional because the color is so even and your hair barely looks damaged!
I like your hair and glasses. You have a great sense of style. They also flatter your eyes.
You look like a modern sort of pinup girl.  I am so digging the hair and bangs and the glasses.   And after digging through your posts, I can say you are pretty awesome with confidence.  I also love your dog.  He is a handsome boy.
You are really cute. I like you
Love your hair! Definitely suits you. Wish I could rock all blue.
Oml you're such a freakin cutie. As a coloured hair gal myself, I was once told that I'm a very original person. And I'm definitely saying the same to you!! Also be brave enough to be yourself :))
You are absolutely gorgeous, my dear! Believe it, it helps others to see it better😊
Fantastic aesthetic, keep slaying queen
i love your hair !! you’re rly pretty <3
u look nice
You have the exact hairstyle I want. I’ve literally saved your photo so I can go to the hairdresser and ask her to make me as beautiful as you in time for my birthday. Thanks! 💕
you're so cute! you have a really nice face and you somehow look good in bangs. Your eyebrows are actually amazing. is it weird to say you have nice hands? eh whatever. you have nice hands. and your username is so funny.
Your hair is amazing, and you're really pretty!
You have the cutest cheeks 🥰
You are BEAUTIFUL!!! I LOVE your aesthetic/style. Eyebrows are on point, hair is amazing, the glasses look so great on you (I’m jealous cause I need glasses but can never pull them off) and you have a super cute smile! Love yourself xx
I just need to point out that your hair is the absolute BEST SHADE OF BLUE.
Where do we even start! 
Those glasses frames are killer 
They eyebrows - flawless
I’d kill to be able to rock a sweet hair color like that! 
Get it girl!
You have a beautiful smile, and your hair colour is gorgeous!
Best username I saw this month
Such a great aesthetic! Loooove the glasses and hair! If I saw you in the street I’d be jealous of you js
I think you have a beautiful face and my son says you have cool hair!
You have such a beautiful face! Porcelain doll vibes
I have blue hair too! That's why you're cool :)
Your brows are perfect and your glasses are exceptionally well-suited to your face!!
Your eyebrows are perfect!
You have a great choice in glasses.
I love your hair and your haircut!
your skin looks really well cared for it. I just watched like eight makeup tutorials that say if you have great skin the rest of it's easy. I do not have great skin.
You are absolutely adorable!!
I love your hair, I wish mine looked as good as that back when I dyed it!
Love your username!

EDIT: seriously it always makes my day when I see a post from a creative username. 🏏🥋🤺🤹‍♀️🎬🎲🧩🎰
Blue is a good choice.
(I was going to edit my og comment but i cant find it so im reposting it, oof.)
Blue, great choice!
*cheesy joke here*
You literally have the perfect face! Beautiful smile, hair color, brows 🥰 please know you are not alone 😉
I like eggs too
I love your hair!!! And you have a super cute smile! Those glasses are adorable, eye brows look great, and I want your shirt!! Haha
I love your hair and glasses!!! They go so well together :)
IlliterateEgg on Toast? 
What are you insecure about? McDonalds wanting to steal your user name?
Breaking the internet cuteness meter?

Well, cheers!🥂😻😻😻
Sorry for all caps but I LOVE YOUR FACE YA CUTIE
You look like such a sweet kind person.
I’m so jealous of those glasses! I don’t have the right face for those. The hair, the glasses, makeup, everything. I love it! ❤️
No no! Don't delete it! Holy goodness you are so pretty and you look like a porcealine doll my dear. You look like such a kind and genuinely good person
You are cute as a button I love your style :)
You seem so sweet, and your hair and  makeup is gorgeous! You’re totally the kind of person my socially awkward, shy ass would see in public and go “she seems nice, i’ll sit next to her!”, which I think is the best kind of person.
You’re extremely cute and beautiful. I love your hair and your smile :)
Blue hair suits you
I really liked it when you murdered Walder Frey and his family. Also, that slick knife trick when you stick the Night King was bitchen.
Great smile, very cute
Your hair is cute af
Heyy! You're beautiful! And I'm not saying that just for the sake of making you feel good! It's a fact ❤ I love your hair! You sure do rock it! Matches with your blouse too haha! And you glasses, it perfectly suits your face!! You come across as someone who's friendly, gentle, approachable, and kind. 

Love, I wish you could take your insecurities and completely do away with them. From what I see, they have no reason to stay. You're beautiful and you're worthy to be seen in the best light possible. 💛
Love the blue hair. I think you look adorable.
I am late but you are rocking that hair and you have a lovely smile!
I think that your eyebrows are ridiculously and well sculpted. also, I really like how your hair frames your face into a heart shape. Way to go, you classy broad!
Pardon me for making assumptions, but you definitely seem like the quirky type, not rawr xd quirky, but like actually quirky in an enjoyable and wholesome way
You are so cute, and I bet you can read, too!

I love that big eyebrows are back. When I was a teenager, we were all trying to get them pencil-mark skinny. But I loved the movie Pretty Woman...man...Julia Roberts had caterpillars on her face! You've found a nice, shaped, seductive medium.
Don’t delete it, you’re the CUTEST!
You’re so pretty, I love your hair and style, and your skin is amazing! You also look like one of those people that is so nice that it literally shows on their face at all times
Love the glasses, they really go with the rest of your adorableness
Omg no like lowkey you're whole aesthetic is on point, like, blue hair/its length, shaped eyebrows, glasses, and all. Like for real even if you hadn't posted a toast I would have commented that just so you know.
You have a very pretty smile :)
I love your hair.
I find you really cute ^^
Your hair and shirt match. That's pretty epic.
Your hair color looks great on you. Your one of the few people who picked a color that suits them well!
Ramona Flowers is that you?
I love that hair. Metal vibes <3 Feel my pain lol its hard to pull that color with a brown skin tone :(
Gorgeous with a don’t give a shiv expression. Keep killing it girl!
I love your username!!! It made me giggle :) Also your eyebrows are really well done, you look great! Have a wonderful night :)
You're cute. Keep spreading love, the world needs more love.. the world is better when you're in it!! It's good to be insecure! Too many egotistical cunts around! Love you <3
That lipstick color looks great on you!

I absolutely adore your hair!
Holy shit, you’re frickin gorgeous and I love your style!
You look easy to become friends with.
Your username doesn't reflect anything negative about you. In fact, illiterateegg makes you sound funny and creative.

:)
Cute. Sassy. Sense of fashion. There is absolutely nothing wrong with you. Stay strong, trust your heart, and tell that voice that doesn't like you to go fuck itself. You're awesome. 💪
Your hair cut and colour looks so beautiful on you!!! 💓💓💓

Thank you so much!!
I was about to say the same thing
Thats true
Came here to say this. I agree, you look like a genuinely kind soul.
no harm in being polite :)
Thank you! My dog is an angel and sometimes just as much as a derp as yours ((:
Lots of curling, plus mascara and falsies! I get mine from House of Lashes (:
Hi, thank you so much for all of this!! I use the Gloss Bomb by Fenty Beauty 😄
I did it myself!
Thank you!! Happy cake day (:
what
Hey dude, I appreciate you taking time out of your obviously very busy life to comment, but you're in the wrong subreddit. Troll elsewhere (:
Do we mean "I hope never more for you to post your face as I don't want to look at it" or "I wish you the speediest recovery of confidence that you never more need for Toastme, being the walking embodiment of the sub? “


P. S. The 2nd one is the correct one... 🤫
not sure what the intention with this comment was
Please no advice, comment removed. Thanks!
Hey! Thank you for the concern, I really just need a haircut. My hair is generally well taken care of and overall pretty soft, I just don't have the money to get it cut and don't want to try to do it myself (:
You're in the wrong subreddit, dude.
You're in the wrong subreddit.
Love them! I’ve never been great at the art of make-up but I do like to wear a little mascara from time to time so I’ll definitely have to look into getting a curler and maybe trying out some falsies. Thank you for sharing!
I never would’ve noticed wow!
U dont watch game of thrones?
nope!
U look like one of the protagonist, Arya stark.
You are stronger than your addictions. You deserve happiness. You will get through this.
I'm proud of you. I hope you know that we are all rooting for you. Remember to replace bad habits with good ones and to have fun doing new healthy things. Running is a great way to clear our heads, I highly recommend you run in the woods when you feel that your head is too crowded. You can start of with just 15 minutes. For me it helps the most to sprint as fast as I can and get the adrenaline going.
Edit: post was sent to Automod queue and authorising mod was blind and missed the verification. Much shame🤦‍♂️. Have an upvote 


You are taking a massive step with the recovery and rehab. Much respect, pal. You are a fighter and don't forget it.
Aw c/mon man you'll be alright. Try meditation to calm your mind.
as someone who struggles with intrusive thoughts as well, just try to be as patient as you can with yourself. it’s overwhelming to constantly have to battle with yourself, but just know that it doesn’t mean that there’s anything inherently wrong with you. fighting for your inner peace is difficult, but as you slowly reach that point, you will feel even more accomplished than you would ever think possible. just know that you are fully capable of reaching happiness, i undoubtedly believe that you will get there <3
you are an incredibly strong person for staying clean. I have been off the pills for nine years. the first months were a bit hard but after that everything settled and it's the best thing I have ever done in my life.
you got this mate!
You go bro, it ain't easy getting clean but it's worth it, kick that addiction s butt, you got this admitting to an addiction is the first step towards recovery, if you need someone to talk to during those trying times, chat me up! Good luck we're all cheering for you, you're strong!
Hey there friend, glad you are here and reaching out for support and kindness. You have a kind face, and I get a "cool nerd" vibe from you, like you'd be fun to play D&D with or to debate with. And you really pull off those round eyeglass frames, not a lot of people can.

Also for whatever it worth: Know that your thoughts and feelings are not always truth, and you can acknowledge and accept them without giving in to them. Please find ways to take care of and be kind to yourself, even if it's only little things, despite whatever those thoughts are telling you to do or feel.
Hey man it’s all good, beating an addiction when you’re young will make the rest of your life seem just a tad easier (remembering this time). I just about went back to pills after 3 and 1/2 months this week end! Relied on my parents heavily, I’d recommend the same! And therapy if not yet!
I'm going to try to address everything in your post, but I'm scatterbrained so forgive me if I fail. When I was 20, I too felt crushed, and had a crippling heroin addiction. So I get it dude. My head is still crowded with anxiety, self doubt, and fear. Fwiw I'm in my 30's now. Let me tell you what I wish somebody told me when I was your age. *it gets harder, but it gets better too.* fuck society. Fuck their expectations. Live for yourself. Do what you want. There is no other point in life. I bet you are a creative and smart individual. Fuck the rabble, be yourself, and be yourself *hard.*
IT is hard, but you are STRONGER than that. Every person who beats this makes the rest of us stronger!
Unfortunately, happiness doesn't come on it's own when you go clean, but staying clean opens up every possibility of achieving happiness. You took the step to put the pills away and that shows that you have the strength to stay away. Just let it take its time! And hey, you've got the rest of your life to find your happiness, so hang in there! :)
Congratulations for going clean after pill addiction. You make the impression like you are a very sensitive maybe extremely empathic person. Maybe meditation would help to focus more. In the beginning it is about focusing on your breathing. I started with some YouTube videos on meditation and it has helped me through some crazy parts in my life. Check YouTube for ‘guided meditation’. If I look at your picture, I can see you being a western guru of tomorrow, once you mastered the meditation skill and once you dive deeper into these topics.
thank you so much <3
thank you so much, this advice is really meaningful and i think its going to be helpful <3

its true, im so glad that i have wonderful parents that are able to help me out <3
omg no worries re: addressing everything in the post. this is such a meaningful message, i cant believe how inspiring and kind everyone is being. congratulations on beating your addiction <3
thank you so much <33
In fairness I get put off when I GET THEM the right way round, so developed is my reverse image read. It was just a little off to the side but caught myself just after!

All the best pal. Don't let anyone shake u
no problem :’-) just know if you need anyone to reach out to, ill be here to listen.
You're welcome! Hope you are well.
Hey dude I want to say that recovery from addiction is a lifelong process. But it's *your* process. My sobriety is different from yours which is different from hers from his and so on. If you can get out while you're young, I salute you. And if it takes longer, I forgive you ♥
:D
hey likewise! thank you again
Boy you better stop, you cute :)
You have beautiful eyebrows! And a lovely thick head of hair.

Facial asymmetry isn't always obvious to other people, and it doesn't mean you aren't attractive, take Bradley Cooper for example.

You deserve a wonderful, happy and successful life and I believe in you.
You look handsome
Lighten up on yourself buddy! Your a handsome man! Doing hell of a lot better than I did at 19. Focus on your schooling and don’t let life get you down! Your special someone is out there waiting for you somewhere. 

Keep doing what your heart tells you and don’t let doubt deter you from the great things I know you can accomplish.
I simply cannot believe how people see themselves.  Everyone else sees a handsome guy with beautiful thick hair- and you’re obviously bright- the world is your oyster.  Here is the best advice I ever received- some 40 years ago-and it applies now more than ever: if you want to feel good about yourself, you need to do things you can feel good about.  Focus on that, the rest will follow.
Dude, you have great, thick hair and some pretty damn good looking eyebrows! I think you have a very good face shape and you should definitely be more confident about your looks!

I promise that you can get through these things. You’ve made it to college which is great!!! Keep going and enjoy every minute of the journey. 

I’m rooting for you man!
You look great! You're eyebrows.. literally goals lol

Keep your head up!
Dude most people dont have a symmetrical face, doesnt mean youre not a good looking guy lol

And also you got some nice hair man, i wish mine looked like that

Rock on man, you got this
There are many, many women who don’t care about a man’s height. This whole “over 6ft” trope is bullshit. 

What matters is who you are, and you sound like a terrific person. 

No one’s face is symmetrical, but as a stranger when I first saw this pic I didn’t notice/think anything about asymmetry, I looked straight at your eyes, they are amazing!

Edit: and those eyebrows!!!
You have some Noah Centineo vibes going on!
Facial asymmetry? Boy, I wish I looked that good when I was your age. As far as height goes, a lot of that is in your mind. I'm 5' 7" (on a good day) but it's never held me back from anything.
Boy oh boy, you're handsome!!! If only you can see what we're seeing! 💛
Thank you all so much for your kind words!!! I just joined this sub last night and the response has blown me away! I think it was the right choice. The best things I can do right now are to keep working for myself and to dive into this amazing community with all my heart. I hope I can keep it going :)
Right back at ya :)
Thank you so much, I needed to hear this. I wish you all the happiness in the world😊
Thank you 😊
Thank you. Let's hope I can keep moving forward :)
I'm feeling better already. Thank you 😊
I second this!!! 💯
it's actually kind of a good thing when someone leaves you because now you have room for someone who ACTUALLY loves you to come in. You look like a nice and handsome guy, so I'm sure you'll do just find meeting someone! Keep your head up! :)
Dude I got my philosophy degree and then got my masters in public policy. It’s not a shit degree, great foundation but I do recommend going back to school. FYI: if it sounds daunting, go to Europe for your masters. Cheaper, quicker, and less barriers to enroll (no shitty GMAT). I’m assuming you’re American.

try to be thankful. You realized she wasn’t a genuine person to you. You look young. You have your whole life ahead of you. I’m excited to hear about your new gf in Europe ;)
You are a really handsome guy. You have lovely, big eyes and you have good facial structure. 

I am so sorry for the loss and heartbreak you must be suffering through now. But please remember that what she did is a reflection on her and not you. You can now find someone who actually loves and cares about you. It could take time but I promise that there is someone out there who will make you forget about what happened and make you feel loved.

Your dog is adorable by the way and I am sure he is very lucky!
What a lucky pup! 8 years is quite a long time, and I’d imagine things might be a bit uncertain for a little while. What I’m seeing though, is a young, handsome, college educated bachelor with a sweet pup by your side. Im sure you have a bright future ahead of you even if you can’t see it. Best of luck to you my man ❤️
Your dog is adorable and well loved, and your nose piercing suits you very very well. 8 years is ages and I’m very sorry for your loss of time- but it also heals all wounds or whatever (I’m sure you’re wiser than me with that degree). One goal is enough to stay afloat as far as I’m concerned ♥️
The end of a relationship is always hard to deal with, so don’t beat yourself up about finding things difficult. 

Think of it this way: your life is a film, and you’re at the start of a new scene after the previous scene ended dramatically. You don’t know yet what’s going to happen in this new scene, other than during it your heartache inevitably declines. But you can make the scene better to live through or worse to live through by the choices you make about the storyline. Choose well. (Or don’t. You’re young and single, there’s no better time to make crazy choices. But choose *something*.

Secondly, your degree is not worthless. Clear and logical thinking is valued by many employers, and it will make you a better employee. Getting a more specialist postgraduate qualification will help if you would like a career in a particular speciality, but it’s not essential. 

Finally: looks aren’t everything, but you’re clearly a good looking guy. Out there in the world is the next love of your life. Go gettem!
I promise you it will get better.
Your dog is adorable and wants you to be successful :)
Hang in there bro, like people say as one door closes another one opens and dont think of your relationship ending as a bad thing, she wasnt your soulmate she was there to prepare you before you go on to meet her one day soon, hope life picks up for you m8 and your god has always got your back remember that
 Not a lot of people can rock a nose ring but it looks so sick on you. Any lady would be luck to have you!
My friend has a 4 year philosophy degree and he works for the county making pretty solid money. Philosophy teaches employable skills, no matter what STEM people say. You can break down issues into smaller parts and reconstruct them in ways others cannot. Critical thinking is a skill. Putting complex cause and effect scenarios into clear writing is a skill. Quick thinking, agile mentality, and an understanding of schemas, tropes, signs, etc....these are things people will pay for. Things a machine will not replace any time soon. People who major in philosophy and literature, my best professor ever once said, major in INDETERMINACY. Market your mind. Your education has value. Also, sometimes "destroy and rebuild" can be extremely cathartic. Hang in there man. You got this.
Okay, let me be a little superficial first. You are VERY handsome and I mean that seriously, not just saying it to cheer you up. If I saw you walking down the street, I'd probably find it hard to walk normally and not look at you type of handsome lol.

Now I'm really sorry about what happened. Even though, as others said - it is good she "let you go" NOW cause if she left for another guy, she would have probably left later anyway - it still doesn't erase the pain. You'll feel down for a while and it will suck, eight years is a long time, but after you get through the hard part, it's done. You just have to hang on. It gets easier day by day. Just remember it's essential to feel the emotions now so you can live free later. 

I hope you (and your sweet little doggo) will have beautiful times ahead. With or without a new girlfriend, give it time and don't stress about it. Try out some new hobbies, do something you've always wanted to do, hangout with friends etc. Anything to pass the time.

My inbox is always open (for you and for anyone needing). Hope my butchered English made some sense at least.

All the best for you!
They didn't leave you after 8 years, you gained 8 years of experience to find the actual one!
Your pup is absolutely adorable and so are you. Don’t let a breakup wear your spirits down, I promise it’s only uphill from here. Just focus on the positives ahead, like getting a kick-ass degree!
You’re above average looking for sure. You’re smart enough to have graduated college. In context of the world, you are probably in the richest 5% of people on the planet. Ending relationships can be hard, but the best way to move on from one is to strengthen your most important relationship, the one with yourself. 

Don’t tell yourself all the bad stuff you’ve done, start with the good stuff. Don’t get too down on yourself, love yourself man. You deserve to be happy, but only you can do it for yourself.
You look totally attractive and probably a good conversationalist with a complicated degree and all!
You’re going to be okay. 8 years is a long time, but let’s not assume things we don’t know because that’s illogical and it will hurt you more to ruminate on something that probably isn’t true. I believe that you can find your passions and make them your reality, but you need to begin by exploring them. Go to meetup (it’s a site and an app) and anything you see that remotely interests you that you haven’t tried, go do and see if you like it. It doesn’t mean you’re not successful if you’ve never tried something, it means you fear settling so you need to do some exploring. Don’t fall into the pitfalls of nihilism. You’re meant to do something great , and all you need to do is sit down and plan out each individual step and time of when you are going to achieve them. Also, I’m envious of your nose ring because I would like to pull one off but I don’t see it happening lol.
You're handsome and smart and a dog lover. There is a huge market for people like you! Philosophy isn't worthless!!! You aren't either friend.
Good skin, full facial hair, and a great taste in canine companionship. I think physically, you're great.
I felt like this really recently, like I had nothing to look forward to in life so what was the point? Just take one goal at a time, the rest will follow. If your dog is all you got right now, it’s a damn good place to start. All the best :)
Dodged a bullet, your lucky. Make the most of it!!!
You are worth way more than that other guy, she left because she saw all your worth and it was too much for her. You. Are. Appreciated. Much love
You're super cute and personally, I'd be into a guy with a philosophy degree.
It all takes time, friend, and it'll be hard. Take the time and space to grow despite the hurt, because you deserve so much more in life. In the meantime, we're all here for you and rooting for you! You're adorable, deep, and intelligent, and you've got a lot of great worldly experiences to look forward to :)
For what it’s worth I have a Philosophy degree and a successful career in tech where I regularly get compliments on my writing - all those philosophy papers will pay off eventually!  Also you are a very good looking dude with a cute snuggly dog, things are going to work out for you professionally and in your love life.  Sometimes life just has to jolt you a bit to move you forward to the next phase.
I’m not gay but you’re easily a 10/10, godDAWM you’re handsome as fuck
A lot of my friends from law school had undergrad philosophy degrees. If you think critically about text, you can be a great lawyer!
My uncle is a very successful philosophy professor. That’s not a worthless degree. You have very pretty and kind eyes. Your puppy looks perfect. Things will work out, honey. There wouldn’t be rainbows if it were not for rain. Keep being awesome.
Well hey at least you know your dog will always love you! Sometimes they make better friends than people because they’ll give you unconditional love ❤️
You truly are a handsome man, and I love your dog (looks like a German Shepherd, I have one too!). Take the time to find a new hobby, travel, and develop a better love for yourself! You have our support and I can’t wait to see what adventures you and your fur baby embark on!
you're a cute guy
One: you crochet. Which is fucking awesome in and of itself. 

Two: you’re a deep thinker, as evidenced by your philosophy degree. 

Three: you have a dog. And you love him/her. +100 points automatically. 

Four: you’re very attractive, and I have no doubt you can find someone else very easily. 

You’ve got this. You’re full of awesome.
Maybe I’m seeing something here that is neon. 8 years and you refer to her as your live in gf? Perhaps she needed a stable progressive life and that wasn’t it. I don’t blame her for moving on, regardless of who or what you are.  She obviously wanted what you didn’t have to offer. That being said, move on, focus on your degree, job, life. The right person will cross your path.
Couple things, mate. You got your health and your pups health. You may be down but you’re not out, and philosophically speaking, she may have been a very important part of your life, but she is not your entire ontology.  Get your degree; do it for you and keep moving along until you find your purpose. You got this.
You have a dog that loves you more than anything, and more importantly you have a reset in your life. It will hurt like hell for a while but this is still a good opportunity to fill your life up with goals, dreams, and ambitions. Be the man your dog k ows you are!
The same thing happened to me (on a smaller scale but still) my girlfriend left me for another dude it's been about 6 months since then and I found someone even better and she's still alone... Just remind yourself that it will always get better no matter how bad it gets. Good luck man 👍
Dude get that philosophy degree then go travel! If you have a bachelor's you can teach English in many places outside of the US. You can make good money in Vietnam for example and get a chance to see the world. I traveled after my live in gf dumped me and it helped me a lot. I realized I can do very exciting and interesting things on my own. Plus you're very attractive so finding another that loves you for you is easy once you feel better within and love yourself. Don't you compare yourself to whatever dick she might be with and focus on the love that is waiting for you to be open to it. 

I'd say, if you are into it, plan to go somewhere new once you graduate. Reward yourself for your hard work by taking a break and seeing something that amazes you because this world is amazing and there's no shortage of awe inspiring experiences to be had!! 
❤
You are very attractive, and my biggest crush was was a super hot philosophy professor, so don’t say the degree is worthless! BTW, who is your favorite philosopher?
You look like a nice guy, and I trust a dog's judgement so you can't be too bad. What's their name? Also, I can kinda see that you have a tattoo so that's cool too! I really like your facial hair, too, and I think that's sometimes hard for guys to pull off but you do it well.
You are ROCKING that nose ring! Sorry to hear about the end of a relationship. Give yourself time to grieve, but don't lose hope. We live in a giant world with lots to live for ♥️ Also side note you've got gorgeous hair and eyes
i love you!!! in the years to come you will succeed further than ever before
My Sociology degree was "useless" until I learned how to market it in my new field. Everything is a transferable skill and how you connect your studies to your job is key.

For example, I used the Milgram Experiment as a reference in a major study with one of the top amusement parks. I nerded out so hard :)

You got this. You got puppy. You got a degree. You got a nice face. It's all daunting now, but "it won't be like this all the time"!

(Saw that last line on some street art yesterday and it really stuck with me.)
Keep that handsome chin up. As you know, life is full of disappointments. They make the great times so much sweeter. You have a lot going on for you! I read a lot of your comments that you made to people in this post, and you seem like a super sweet guy. Keep loving on that dog. This too will pass. Good luck to you!
I know this may sound kind of hollow but it's true, it does get better. 8 years is a long time to spend with someone, but if that person can just walk away from 8 years like that then it was never meant to be in the first place. And your degree is far from useless. in the world we live in today, we need more great minds thinking about big ideas rather than small minds thinking about the same thing everyone else does.
I’ll echo others who point out that your degree is far from worthless. It’s teaching you how to think well. And that’s a skill set in high demand. Public policy. Jurisprudence. Leadership development. Business ethics. You have a lot of great options. Just don’t forget what got you curious about philosophy to start with. That curiosity will never let you down. 

And you’ve got a great dog!
As someone going through something pretty similar man I know you can do it. Itll be hard and it's not like you'll be able to make feelings disappear but you have to work on yourself. Which I know wont be a problem because it seems you got your head on straight with you and that cute dog of yours. Also dude your pretty good looking so you got one foot in the door
Bruh. I feel ya. My wife left me after 10 years with some dude she met on the Xbox. That was 10 months ago. Still not over it. I just retired from the service and have no clue what I want to be when I grow up...

So I was tossing around the idea of strippers and coke 😆 just kidding, but it does sound fun. Every day is a struggle, but I make it through. With the support of the 5 dogs, 2 cats, and a ferret she left me with.

I'm not trying to one up you on the pity train, just letting ya know you're not alone in this.
But you have a dog that loves you and cuddles you and dogs are a good sign of character so you must be a great person
You’ve got a nice evangelion tattoo going for you!!!
You can get into many many graduate programs with your “just a philosophy degree!”
A philosophy degree makes for interesting and intelligent conversation. There are niche jobs out there where you can put it to good use!
You are a BABE. 🖤
You seem to be a deep soul and, if she picked the other dude for success or other superficial stuff, she was obviously not the right one for you. I know you will find a woman that appreciates you deepness and who shares the same views. Once you have found your way and stopped getting distracted by doubts that what gives you joy could not be attractive or so... 😉
She's got no idea what she's missing, man. You got looks, you got a thinking mind, and you got a heart of gold. Focus on being your best self. If someone wants to walk out of your life, and they can't bother to see all the good you have in you, let them walk. You gotta live your best life whether it's what everyone else wants or not. Stay strong my friend 💪 I know it hurts, but you can do this. Better days will come.
Getting over from something like that will take time and time only. Just remember not to mask your emotions and deal with them as you see fit, naturally avoid heavy drinking/other substances.

&#x200B;

Few facts:

\- You´re handsome, there´s no denying that (no homo lol)!

\- Your dog is loyal to you and as it happens to be, you have the most beautiful breed in the world -> a man of good taste !

\- None of the degrees are worthless.. None. It becomes worthless if you don´t use it correctly or continue your studies.

\- Come to Finland and continue your studies here, i believe that we are one of the best "educational" countries there is. 

\- Now you "know" at least one person from here so what are you waiting for !

&#x200B;

You may PM me if you need more information about possible studies here :)
You look like a normal chill dude, at least you have that awesome dog. Does the dog still have your back? Of course! Because you deserve it.
Thanks guy, it’s actually the first time in many years I’ve felt somewhat attractive. Sometimes relationships devolve into fear of losing your partner and subtle insults out of insecurity. Never been more confident in appearance, but damn the timing.
Ya know this has a really nice appeal to it, and I hear they removed the quarantine on pets a couple years back. Sometimes big goals like this help, thank you.
Thanks bud, this mindset works when I can stick with it. I’ve been through 8 years of foster care, 8 years juve, and now 8 years with my ex. Just gotta start the next scene, I get you, thank you.
Fact !
This is actually something I’ve been thinking about after some advice from this post. I’ve stayed dormant for so long and I think it’s restricted my views, yet I think I like this as a goal. Thank you so much for your positive words.
Also there's quite a bit you can do with a philosophy degree, I think it gets a bad rap (at least in the media) but I have a couple friends who are philosophy majors and are using it as a jumping point for other endeavors (law school, med school for psychiatry, research in human behavior/psychology)
No don’t worry sometimes it’s nice to normalize my situation. Self loathing can be cathartic for a time until it festers too long and becomes dangerously un-empathetic when you no longer are able to see outside yourself. Thank you for that, it’s refreshing to hear other people make it work.
Damn that’s some nice observation skills, maybe rewatching that show right after the breakup wasn’t the healthiest move but it was refreshing lol.
Every time something really shitty happens to me, I try to change up my environment. I moved to Europe as an American last year. If you have any questions, PM me. You can do it!
One of my best bids and highly respected auditor in my work has a philosophy degree. Really useful and great degree.
I think you missed the part where I said I retired from the service? Small words work better for me. Monosyllabic even 😆

The best advice I have is: Get out there. Do your thing. Have fun and just enjoy the day one at a time.
As cliche as it is, it will get better
Thankfully you aren’t in Shinji’s position!!! But take your time to do things you enjoy. Remember to reward yourself for the small things. You’re doing great!
Wait, can I PM you?
Haha yeah sorry sometimes when I drink I subconsciously talk a tiny bit pretentious, and you do the same bud, I appreciate it.
I don't know what you consider a binge, or what you're binging with, but it's probably not healthy, and not helping the healing process. If it's alcohol, take it in moderation. Go out with friends, or acquaintances and become friends, have a few drinks, *responsibly*, and just enjoy it.
Oh fuck you freaked me out for a second cause my dogs name is Shinji and I was a little concerned for my safety lmao
Sure
I feel you, it’s a vice ive been cutting back on, me and my ex used to be heavy drinkers but it’s less appealing alone lately so it’s getting better
ok just to clarify my god awful formatting was thanks to mobile

but also, you've got a great sense of humor if you've named your dog shinji lol
That's good to hear. Already moving on 👍
That is a killer beard, man! I have to say, this post has made my day.

The amount of courage and willpower it took to quit smoking and drinking while going to therapy and trying new things simultaneously is really, really admirable. 

I hope you continue down the right path man. You’re definitely heading in the right direction :)
Congrats on everything my man! Here's the thing about cig - they're the hardest to quit. However, in another couple months you get this reverse mindset where you see one and immediately say "how the hell did I do that?... nasty". 

And nice beard.
Hey, you're rocking a killer beard and you made it through the worst of a horrible depression. It sounds also like you're trying a lot of different things to improve your life and that's only a good thing. Keep it up, friend, and good things will only follow!
That’s awesome. You’re looking good, healthy and relaxed. Things are going to be good.
sounds like you are finding your slice of happiness. good on you my friend. the unknown is always a bit of a mystery but that is life to be experienced.
Love the beard! 😍 You look so handsome and it looks like you’re on a good path, my friend. Keep it up!
You’re on the right track. Having quit at least two addictions, you’ve shown you have a lot of strength. The road out of depression isn’t a straight one; when the going gets tough remember your inner strength
Good job buddy for fighting and putting you vices behind you. You are already on your way to recovery. Cheers to you!
Easiest toast yet when everything you're doing is fxing awesome
Way to go man. That feeling of hope is your reward for all the positive choices you're making. Good job.
Keep at it man! You're looking good!
You’re doing awesome! You are tackling multiple, extremely difficult things all at once, and you’re killing it! You’ve got this 😊 you’re also extremely handsome 😊
I don't know you but I'm so very proud of you and excited for you. These kind of life changes can be daunting before we do them but once you find the rhythm it gets easier and easier. I hope you have all the success and I'm rooting for you. 

Also your beard is fantastic😍 and you should totally post on r/beards you would be well received over there too.
Omg that is awesome to hear, I'm proud of you for stepping up!! It's a long and hard journey so go easy on yourself, alright? You should be proud, keep it going!!
Btw you have such a great beard
You're really cute! I know that attractiveness is a shallow thing to comment on, and in the grand scheme of things doesn't hold much worth, but it sounds like you’re also creating a really solid foundation with your lifestyle choices as well. I know it’s hard now— I wouldn’t wish depression on my worst enemy— but I know you’ll look back on this time with triumph once you’re happier than ever. People are lucky to know you!
There is this moment (actually a lot of moments)( where you're out there without your crutch and life just takes your breath away. You feel like you're drowning. You sir, are strong enough to overcome these moments.  


Stay on the meds. STAY ON THE MEDS. Call your friends. Make sure to have something for them, maybe a meal, a movie or what, but nurture those relationships. If I oculd get over a few of my issues, you can beat this.
Major kudos on all of those tough changes, sounds like you've really turned a corner. You're demonstrating some incredible strength and you have a great face! Good luck with everything!
You are such a role model man! you're awesome!
Yeah it’s scary but good in the long run. From the sounds of it this is a complete turn around for you so it should feel strange. Proud of you internet friend, you deserve all the happiness that comes to you. Also amazing beard.
Mad jealous of your beard. Keep up the good work, hobbies definitely help, and so do friends. You are what you believe yourself to be, and that can be a spiral if you lose that belief in yourself. Stay positive friend!
Congrats! It’s really hard, speaking from experience, but what you’re doing is worthwhile. Keep going!
Swimming tho.... 

I think sun and excersize can do some great things for your mood. Keep that up.
You look great, and you're already accomplishing big things. Keep your head up and keep on keeping on!
Good for you taking the first steps to regain the control in your life.  Be proud of yourself.
Proud of you! Meds, therapy, exercise, and supportive friends have been a great combination for me as well. You've got this! Also, you have a really kind face.
Keep up the good work!!!
Congrats on being sober! It can definitely be scary to start change but you’re doing great! Also I love your beard 😊😊
You look a lot like this youtuber lordminion777, and that isnt a bad thing lol

Rock on dude, you got this
You are very attractive! that beard is glorious and you have a smile in your eyes. Congrats on feeling again. Depression can be hard, but you're here and you're doing things to make yourself feel better. Keep going!
I know exactly how you feel about the scary and good feeling of depression lifting- I’m in it now. Good for you for talking all those amazing healthy steps!!! You’re so capable to live a happy healthy life and you’re good enough and worthy of it all
wow I am really happy and proud to read you are doing so much to help yourself. very soon  you will see the positive results, I promise.
I have been drug and depression free for about nine years, so I can tell you by experience the hope you feel is real.

have a lovely day.
I’ve struggled with depression my entire life and I think this is a *good* thing. Only people who have experienced the highs and lows of human existence can create something *truly* great.
I'm in the same place my friend. Keep your mind and body busy.
Wow.. thanks everyone! This sub is so nice! Made my day that much better. Nice to feel something positive from social media!
I’m jealous of your beard.
Sweet beard you’ve got there!
Proud of you man!!! I know a lot of folks who aren’t doing half the self care you are while going through these changes. Get ready to meet a new exciting version of you!!
This makes me so happy to hear! Looking good too!
You iz one handsome mothafucca.
My friend, you are so goddamn brave and so goddamn cool. This post makes me insanely happy to see. I find it hard to find the words to convey how beautiful I think this is because I so deeply want it to be heard. Keep doing exactly what you’re doing <3
I wish I could upvote this more than once. I second every single thing said here. Kudos to you OP.
I’m sorry to hear about your mom. I once read that we are never truly adult until our parents pass; but people live on in our memories of them and I believe we honor them through those memories. Nobody ever loves us like a mother can but we love others and are loved in other ways. I hope you find much peace and love in your life.♥️

Oh, and you have excellent glasses 😊
Let me preface this by saying, I posted this earlier on another subreddit and a kind stranger suggested I post here, which after much debate here I am. Unfortunately, it is a mere copy/paste below of the original as that was hard in its own to do. Thank you for listening. 


Umm, this is a hard thing for me, not quite sure how to go about this other than be honest and hope I imagine. I lost my mom due to lupus this year, and being that she was the only parent who played a role in my life, it has been quite devastating to say the least. I got stuck with one of my aunts, and my cousin as the only real family I have at this point, and even to say they least, they have done more harm than good. I could go on and on with this post but why bother, by now you get the point. The most support I have received is from my friends, although as they are male it is so much harder for me to talk and be open to them like I can a girl. And honestly, I would be so very content with listening over talking myself about the above, for the sole fact that a change of pace would be so nice at this point. Dread aside, I like to listen to music or watch a good movie, play videos games, and laugh as a few interests or “distractions.” It isn’t that I don’t have fun, just when I am alone lately, I dunno. I’ve said enough. Even if no one posts a reply, thank you for listening reddit I appreciate it.
It’s been 22 years since my mom died. It gets easier but it never goes away. Regardless of what/who you believe/don’t believe in, your mom will reveal herself to you different, subtle ways. A memory, a smell, a story someone tells you. She’s there. 

Don’t hold yourself up to someone else’s standard of what it means to grieve, don’t repress your feelings either. 

I know for a fact your mom loves you.
Take your time to grieve for your mom. I also lost my dad two months ago and I still cry randomly whenever something happens that reminds me of him. I feel your pain. You may feel alone but I believe they're out there rooting for us. Hang tight fella. I hope someday you'll find your rainbow in your sky.
My cousin lost his dad at 23. I could see it was really hard on him. It can’t be easy on anyone but I know you can get through it.
Keep carrying the good she inculcated in you, remember the best and most important things she passed down, and your life will naturally honour hers
That's really rough. Your kindness and gentle compassion are testaments to the way your dear mother raised you. Remember, she's only a memory away.
Lost my mom at 22, I know how you’re feeling. Stay strong, she loves you and would want to see you blossom! Sending you a big hug!
Your mom loved you, you grew up to be a great person. This is testament to the absolute joy she had raising you. Don't feel too sad, she wouldn't want that.
Lost my mom last august. Im coming up on the first anniversary and I can tell you, you have to take time to be alone and grieve or else you'll destroy yourself. 

There is no other pain in the world quite like it. It gets easier. Keep living, do it for yourself.
I was in the same boat but that was when I was 19. 

Now I’ve lived over half my life without her. 

It’s hard man - but I’ve found i need to work on myself, keep active, and find ways to honor her with my way of being
You were hit with something that will happen to us all, but we hope never will. And you still put effort into dressing well being presentable, which is more than I think I'd be able to say for myself.

I also have to compliment your glasses they fit your face really well, great choice!
I’m so sorry to hear about your loss. Hang in there. Ps your beard is sick
Wow. What a hard time to go through. But the thing is, you will go THROUGH it and come out the other side. You'll never stop grieving. I haven't at least, but life moves forward. You'll never lose her completely. You are a part of her and she is a part of you. 

Never resist the urge to cry or vent or express how you're feeling. Art is good. People are good. You will make it through this hardship. Life will go on. It might feel like time has stopped, but someday it will start again. Sending positivity and respect.
I lost my mother two years ago. I wanted to kill myself. Nothing I can say will make you feel better. You will always think of her and the sadness will hit you like a tidal wave. I'm sorry. <3 Just keep going! You got this!
Thank you everyone for your kind words, this has proven a far more comforting endeavor than I imagined when I did this, so thank you so much. I’m gonna reply to everyone on here, just kinda gotta take it in spurts so I apologize for that. And thank you for listening.
My dad died last year. It sucks. You’ll always think you should have done something different, but as a father, I can promise you that you were perfect in her eyes. 😍
Don't be sad, your mother is still alive in you
Your mom must have been amazing for you to love her so much. If that's true, then she must have passed on all of her positive qualities to you. Her legacy lives through you, and you have the chance to preserve it.
You will get through this.
Don't be afraid to open up to your friends, they won't make you talk unless you want, but I'm sure they will be there for you for anything you want. Even if you don't feel like talking about it, its not good to bottle it up. Talk with them, cry if you need it, there is no shame in that, you even need courage in doing it. I'm really sorry for your lost, and hope you get back in your feet soon
I lost my mom several years ago, even now it sometimes hurts. But it gets easier to do the day to day stuff too. If you need to talk my inbox is always open. 

The thing I found helped me most was turning to my friends. My family, like yours, did more damage than good. But I've built up a family of my own choosing and I wouldn't trade them for the world. 

Take the time to grieve however you need. Remember, you aren't going to grieve the same way as anyone else, and no matter what anyone else tells you, you should only feel what you feel, not what they think you should. It takes a lot of courage to reach out, to friends or internet strangers for help. I hope you find comfort here.
That’s just one of the hardest parts of it all for me to cope with right now, just considering my age, my WHOLE life is such a long fucking time she can’t be a part of and it tears me to pieces.
Thank you however for your honesty, it is appreciated all the same.
Yeah

I get it. I really was just a kid. 

I’m happy to talk more about it - if you’d like to as well send me a PM
I’d like to add that I hope you message me 

And that I might reach out to you first

Edit: did just that - I’d like to support you - for real
Sorry to hear all of that. I hope it all goes well.

We can't see everything from here, but your new hair doesn't look bad to be honest!
That all sounds shitty. I hope your life changes all work out for the best. Depression always sucks and makes everything else worse. But your haircut will grow out and your parrot will bring happiness to others and maybe again to you. Hang in there. You’re young and cute. All things pass ♥️
I'm really sorry that you're going through such a hard time! I hope you won't have to get rid of your friend! (but if you ever need people who aren't gonna judge this community (including me) is always here!) I hope your life's gonna turn for the better! hang in there!
as a side note: the first thing I thought when I saw the picture I though "oh this dude has dope hair!" I actually love the hair and I think the dye job looks good (and the hair colour works great with the colour of your eyebrows 10/10, seriously). I can't see the cut but I'm sure it's not bad! plus you've got a nice face so I'm sure you can pull of even the worst of haircuts!
Stay good my bro and I hope you can find a way to keep your parrot or take it to a good home.
So you're a fighter?  Depression definitely hard-modes things, but you've got this.  Try to ignore the inner jerkass if you can
That's a lot of changes at once, I hope things level out for you soon! Is contacting a pet sitter (or something similar) about a long-term boarding situation an option? Some pet stores and bird breeders will do this too, if you got your pet from one. And your hair looks fine. Good luck with everything!
What’s it cost to keep the pet friend? Not in America or familiar with GoFundMe, but it’s a thing. Is there a way we can make this happen? It hurts my heart.
Parrots can be registered as therapy pets! Please look into this before getting rid of him! If it is registered then you legally are allowed to let it live with you
Knowing he might make someone as happy as he makes me kinda makes it seem better, I’m just going to be so careful who I have to give him to as it breaks my heart to think he’ll keep going from home to home as most large birds do
In honesty a lot more then I would be comfortable receiving, going to have to work a lot of hours to afford to buy a new place as renting is hard with pets. 

Some other factors come in to play meaning it harder to keep him
I’ve been thinking about him. Is there any option that would allow you to give him to someone for a while and take him back later, when your circumstances permit?
He’s at my sisters house atm while I concentrate on work, I might see if she can car for him long term but she already has a parrots 2 dogs and two cats, if she can look after him permanent though I could still see him I guess
Maybe that would work. You could see him and plan to take him back some day. Give it a try? ♥️
bro ur art is SO good and i just get really cool vibes from you wow
You drew those at 18?! That's professional level work right there. I'm a professional artist at a game company and if someone had told me a coworker of mine drew those I would have absolutely believed them. You have a great grasp of 3D space in 2D; your anatomy and shading is fantastic; and overall I just love your style! When I was 18 I couldn't draw like that. Hell, I'm not sure I'm quite that good even now!  
  
There are lots of paths you could take to have a good career in art. Don't let the starving artist stereotype scare you. Game development, for example, would offer 2D concept art, 3D modeling (environments, creatures, characters), animation, or effects. If games don't sound like your thing you could also do graphic design, illustration, 2D or 3D animation for film and tv, comics, more indie type stuff, etc.  
  
I grew up drawing (animals and dragons!) and making little clay animals. Now I 3D model, texture, animate, do effects, and sometimes even rigging (skeletons for the models). It wasn't until I was, coincidentally, 18 that I discovered that game art was an option. I went to college for it but this was before YouTube tutorials were a thing. These days there are several ways to learn what you need to know for whatever art career you choose.  
  
I'd be happy to chat more with you about what path you want to take and how to proceed, critique your art, or if you just want someone to talk to. You're off to a very strong start and I think you've got a great future ahead of you in art! :)
"Walls aren't there to keep us out, walls exist to keep others out who don't want it as badly as we do".

There is a high supply and low demand for artists, but that doesn't mean there is no demand. Work hard, keep at it, make it into a job and you will be able to make a living off of it.
i think your art is gorgeous and you should keep at it. you are also, very beautiful. keep going at your art. if its what you enjoy, don't let anything stop you from continually doing it. <3
Your art is great! Reminds me of a friend who loves to draw. Your art looks like something I would want to see in an artist alley at a convention :)
Dude your art style is amazing! I’m a second year illustration major and I totally love the way you draw people and dragons!!! People love a good dragon drawing it’s hard to pull off and with your art style I totally think you can make money! Never give up on your dream!!
Can we see more of your drawings, they're cool af
I have a friend who works as a 3D artist at a video game company. I think you would do great at something like that. If you're this gifted at 18 you can definitely make it. Just find an education that works for you.
Your art is pretty good. And even if it doesn't take you anywhere, you're still creating something cool and original.
Hey! Fellow artist here! It’s so so so tough to remain positive especially if you’re not getting interaction or business for your art! I just want you to know how amazing you are! I’m so jealous of your talent and creativity! Please keep at it because you seriously so skilled! I hope you have a fantastic week!
Those are some dope dragons. 10/10 would fit perfectly into any illustrations for comics or other kinds of stories with pictures.
I like your art! The lil alien silhouette would make a cool tatt
So jealous of your art! You're amazing!
Okay your art is absolutely amazing!!! 😍
fellow artist here (who really relates to how you feel!), honestly I think your art is really cool! I'd 10000% buy it as a print or sticker if I had the chance! whatever you plan to do with your art, I'm sure you're gonna make it! just hang in there!
also, I really like your colour! did it use to be some shade of pink? either way, adore it!
Your art is so great m. Considering those are just doodles, i can only imagine how amazing a finished artwork by you would be like! Have confidence in your work!
Art doesn’t always translate into a check but it can still take you places in life. It can help you academically. It can be a conversation starter. It can help you network and/or make friends. 

Whether you pursue it as a passion or a profession, art is to be appreciated. First and foremost by yourself. Even on days when the rest of the world passes by, appreciate your own talent and hard work, and remember that no one can take that away from you
I know so many professional visual artists, like 5-10% of them didn't start getting serious about art until after highschool, a few people I know were super serious about art in highschool, then took a huge long break before getting back into it. 
****
Your art looks great, the self doubt is normal af
Hey, great dragons! Seriously. And the demon girl is very well drawn. Your strokes look confident, you obviously know what you're doing, not just doodling randomly like I did when I was your age.
Hey, you're fantastic. You are going places with this. Trust me. I see that you like fantasy artwork. I am a small publisher of RPG books, and I would use your stuff. I know a dozen or more people who would, too. Do you have a deviantart or artstation page?
What?! You drew what’s on your card?! Don’t stop! Don’t give up! Hopefully you will become a great artist, I bet you’d be a great illustrator for books, but even if it isn’t the main driver in your life please don’t give up. You have a talent and you should keep it up.
Your art is amazing! Have you ever considering making a web comic? I think with art like that you could make something wonderful.
Toast: I would be totally cool with your drawing a photo of my family! You're talented enough that I would enjoy seeing your work.

Light toast: I won't pay for it.
That girl is literally the protagonist of an amazing story that just hasn't been written yet. 

You're amazing!
You're absolutely gorgeous, your cosplay is frickin phenomenal, and your art is even more impressive than the latter.
I can just see that you a bursting with creativity and that there is so much you are yet to create. Those drawings are seriously amazing and the quality of them is what I'd expext from drawings in a fantasy story. Keep going and you'll definitely go far.
As someone with no knowledge about how to draw, those look incredible! Awesome! Please do not let the world lose your gift by fear. Keep on keeping on! I wish you all the best! :)
Wow that's so good
Your art is pretty fucking sick dude!! I hope you feel better. I love your hair by the way!!
Holy shit your dragons are amazing. With practice you can definitely find a great illustration or animation career. :)
Well ur frickin gorgeous
Your arts really good! It could lead to fantasy themed commissions in the future, along with other jobs are themed. I wish you luck on the hard times, but don't give up!
If your art is already that good at 18 it's going to take you places, I promise!
You have a really nice style and your grasp of anatomy and shading is really nice
At 18 I wish my art was as good as yours. Just keep practicing and trying to improve!
Yea that kind of art could be used in plenty of places- game design for a new fantasy game. covers for books. The movie industry always needs artists. There are plenty of places art can take you. Just stick with it!
This comment actually made me cry it means so much to hear that. I have been wanting to get into 3D animation for years but my laptop can’t handle simple programs so I have to wait. And currently my art style isn’t consistent enough for animation, I keep changing art style every few frames and it’s kind of annoying. Do you post your art anywhere? I would really like to see some of your work you sound amazing 💛
Thank you so much! Coincidentally I’m applying for a stall at a convention in my city soon, I’m really excited but also worried I won’t get any buyers
Thank you so much. I post on Instagram, my username is Satiriical. I sometimes post on Deviantart, which is also Satiriical.
This comment actually made my day, I really appreciate it. I’m preparing prints to sell at a convention at the end of the year but my self esteem just kinda hit a low and I’ve been telling myself I’m not good enough to sell my art.
Thank you so much! My deviantart is Satiriical, it hasn’t been updated in a bit but I plan on adding more to it. I’ve had that deviantart for nearly five years so you can see me terrible old art on it too
I started a concept for a web comic based off one of my demon characters, Cenetia (the girl in the top corner but drawn more realistically) but I never got around to actually doing it. I might give it another go though
10/10 best toasting
Haha it made me cry that I made you cry! Seriously it means just as much to me that I could help another artist even if it's a small thing.  
  
I don't have a portfolio style place I put my work-related art, [just my cosplay on DA](https://www.deviantart.com/talaayacosplay), but here are a few of my favorite things I've made for the game I work on:  
A scepter that has a stone serpent on it which, when the weapon is drawn, comes to life and flies beside you - [visual link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnRfv3Z3DjM) - [wiki link](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Xiuquatl)  
A floating tome that has a demon imprisoned inside, which creates a shadowy clawed hand around your own - [visual link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD2R5hwVr6Y) - [wiki link](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Binding_of_Ipos)  
An angry little treasure chest mini pet - [link](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mini_Angry_Chest)  
Dragon wings you can wear as a backpack and also glide with - [visual link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upe9FrDJ6kw) - [wiki link](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Scaled_Dragon_Wings_Backpack_Glider_Combo)  
A giant cauldron for Halloween - [link](https://d3b4yo2b5lbfy.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/fa73a10_23-SMK-Screenshot-03.jpg)  
A set of weapons with snakes on them, which internally is called the Danger Noodle set, lol - [link](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Funerary_weapons#Gallery)
You can try low poly 3D animation. It demands less resouses and is very beautiful in its own way. Try Blender, it's free and there's an amazing subreddit where you can learn a lot. Voxels (3D pixels) art is even less demanding to resouses and is super fun to make. Try MagicaVoxel. It's also free and supports animation.
You are SO good enough to sell your art! Hell yes! I know people will love your work! You’ve got such a talent and I can tell buy just the little you’ve shown here! :) I’m so glad I was able to make you feel a little better! If you ever need a friend or to vent or anything im always hanging around :) I’m so excited to hear you’re going to sell your art! I know you’ll do great things :3
What convention?
That stuff is fantastic! I love, love the kirin. Man, I'mma hit you up when I need stuff for my books.
Okay, so your stuff even from when you were 13 is not bad. My favorite pieces of yours are the RICKI series (female Rick from Rick and Morty?), and that Dragon King. Your absolute best is that SamPanther Offspring Custom. That's the kind of thing I really like. You're going to hit the big time one day.
If you do, can you link me its URL? I'd totally follow it, feel free to DM or PM me a link for it, I'd really appreciate it.
This is my little guy Harrison. ~~Turn~~(edit) Draw him into a little monster.

Brisbane Supanova, it’s an Australian thing. I’ve been wanting to sell prints for a long time but always doubted I’d do any good
Thanks for checking out my deviantart, I plan on being more active now that I’ve graduated
Thanks so much! Ricki was basically the female rick and Morty character I made while I was still learning how to draw people, and yeah I was really proud of those two pieces as well.
Yeah I’ll definitely send you a link

&#x200B;

He was much too cute to draw as a monster so I gave him a monster instead

&#x200B;

Sorry he looks a bit older in the drawing I've never actually drawn a child before but I tried my best

&#x200B;

Also sorry its sketchy its midnight, my art skills aren't the best right now

Ah I've heard of Supanova. That's so awesome! Unfortunately I'm in the US so I'm too far away. I wish I could go. I think you're going to do great! And just remember that if you don't sell well, that doesn't mean you're not a good artist!
Have you thought of using watercolor or digital stuff to create a watercolor effect? That SamPanther one (it's what I call a kirin), has such an organic look, i bet if you did things in that style and with watercolor transparency it would look incredible.
Thank you! I hope you have a great day, and don't worry, if you do amazing web comics, I know you can make a living from it eventually. I hear about a lot of amazing webcomic artists that do, and they'll even go to cons and sell merch and books.
I love it! I'm sending it to my wife right now. That was very quick and you're very talented! Keep up the good work and remember that all of the best artists (music, art, literature, etc) often harnessed their skills through frustration and their desire to overcome instead of give up.

Actually watercolour (along with gouache) is my main traditional media I just don’t post traditional stuff often. Sorry for the late reply
I’m really glad you like it, he’s an absolute cutie and I loved drawing him!
I LOVE YOU
Hey you did a good thing be proud of yourself! I chopped off all my hair once too "because I was getting *too much* unfair *advantage*" 🤦‍♀️absolutely hated it but guess what? It grows back. And meanwhile you get an opportunity to develop some personality because you don't have your pretty hair to hide behind anymore/
this might sound weird but... i wish i had ur face shape
I fuckin love your hair. I wish I had hair like that.
It's looking really good! And it is a great gesture what you did a year ago, you should be proud of that!
Not much of a consolation prize, but I rather like your look right now. Very attractive
That is such an amazing thing for you to do, and I think your hair looks absolutely amazing!
The good you did in getting your head shaved, the comfort you provided a child with cancer or their family by doing so, the solidarity you showed them by doing so, can't be measured or trimmed or restyled or in any way improved upon. Consider this dip in self-confidence as your small sacrifice in the service of those more in need of such a boost than you. Have faith that your confidence will return, because it, like your full and gorgeous hair, will return. The world needs more beautiful people like you.
yall really making me tear up with all of your really kind comments. i really needed this <3
I am so proud of what you did! you did a really amazing deed and should be proud of yourself! I wish I had the courage to do something like that!
that said you look really great! your hair is really cute and your face is really attractive! if I were to see you somewhere I'd 100% comment to a friend how attractive you are!
hang in there! I know how hard and anxiety inducing it can be to wait for your hair to regrow (had some not-so-good haircut experiences) but it will regrow and you will be all happy with it again in no time!
I had to shave my head once due to a hair pulling disorder called trichotillomania. Patience is key! And your hair is very long already- keep it up!
Your hair now looks nice as it is, and I'm sure it'll grow back even better than before eventually. You're very pretty to boot. What you did was a good thing, and that'll shine through in your personality.
Do they have a cunning plan for your hair?
You did something amazing. Something that not many could or would do. 

I hope you realize and appreciate that as much as we do
Kudos on the bravery to donate your hair! I'm sorry you're not happy with it now, although I think it's lovely, you have a beautiful color and it frames your face very nicely!
Your absolutely beautiful on the outside but on the inside...your simply angelic. You have more internal fortitude than I do as a 29 year old man. 
 
When you next look in the mirror and have self doubt, just picture the lucky person who is smiling ear to ear with your gorgeous hair! 

God bless you
You did a really selfless thing! You should be proud of yourself :) and! I think your hair looks so cute at the length you have it at :) really flatters you!
Your hair looks great! You did it for a good cause, too. Stay happy :)
HAHA THANKS <3
thank you so much!! :\]\]
thank you so much :\]\]
bless you! thanks so much for this comment, really helping me out to relearn how to love myself :)
thank you so, so much for your comment. this truly means so much. god bless you. :) <3
thank u so so much <3
thank you **SO** much. i really appreciate it <3
thank you, i really appreciate your comment. <3
gosh, i dont know what to say. thank you so much for your comment, i truly appreciate it. being viewed as angelic.. wow that is a sure confidence booster. thank you so so so much!!!! <3
<3
You majestic eagle of a man. Spread your wings and  I'm sure you'll find happiness.
Don’t apologize. You’re beautiful just as you are, and just as deserving of love as your friends. And don’t worry about rushing to get into a relationship, you’ll find someone perfect of you and completely loving.
Brother, I know everyone keeps saying it and it feels like bs, but the most important thing is attitude. 
 ****
Find a human that is excited to spend time with you and makes you feel the same, make "this awesome person thinks I'm awesome" your standard.
  ****
I'm hairier, fatter, and more ginger than you, and once I realized 'a relationship' is not a goal and set out to meet awesome beautiful people my life changed like in days (extreme results I know, a housemate at the time commented on the suddenness of the change)
Don't worry about being fat. My husband is fat and has always been. I love him to death. Just focus on other good things, like sense of humour, some hobby, etc. and you will eventually meet someone who will love you just as you are.
Your skin looks great
there is nothing you should apologise for! you look and are great just the way you are!
I completely understand how you feel but don't worry about it too much! give it enough time you will find the one! 
hang in there and take care!
It's just around every other corner, but timing can be a bitch! One of those days you'll turn the right corner at the right time, don't you worry!
It might be a cliche but you need to love yourself before anyone else can love you. Don’t be so hard on yourself and you have nothing to apologize for
If you’re sorry, do something about it then.

Otherwise don’t apologize.
Dude, everyone is awesome! Just in a different way. It’s about finding out what makes you awesome and unique. And then living it with all your heart. Don’t try to fit in. Try to make a difference. And do what YOU think and feel is right, not what others tell you. And by living it you will find your confidence. And there is nothing more sexy than confidence. Looks fade, character stays. And a great character makes everyone shine. You know those supermodel types that are arrogant and ignorant as f**k? From far away you think they are great. But when you get to know them, their beauty fades. Why? No character. So, work on the character and everyone will want to be like you and with you. I’m sure you will make your way!
The thing is, I have no real social cues or anything, I was pretty much the outsider my whole life and it doesn't help I was abused as a child so there's that too.
We have lived a similar life, in some ways.  I had to actively learn to read people's body language.  Working door helped a lot

****
Edit: Abuse is hard, trust is always a risk, but if someone acts unreasonable, then thank them for the warning sign
Would unreasonable be like dumping a person after 3 months and claiming no chemistry?
People leave, it feels awful, and it's almost, alas, always a good thing in the end.
****
Brother, it's rough, but try not to use it as an excuse to be down on yourself.  It's ok for shit to fail, doesn't make you a failure.
Yeah I know but that was thr first girl to talk to me in 3 years. I know it's hard to change and I work 2 jobs. I huat have no confidence thanks to the abuse.
First, not last
****
 Try not to dwell
Ur pretty hot tbh
Good looking and smart.  Your better than living in a state like Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, Florida, or Texas.  Could also toss in Tennessee or Kentucky.
Job hunting can be so hard, especially when your chosen field isn’t common in your area. You might consider moving out of your state if there just aren’t the opportunities there to launch your career. If it helps you, remember that job hunting is a lot like love - you might strike out 100 times in a row, but you’re really only looking for 1 solid win and all the other rejections are irrelevant. If you feel like you’re getting turned away a lot right not just know that your win is still on the way. Be kind to yourself until that then.
1: Damn, that is some really nice hair. I am jealous!

2: You do realize you can move to another state, right? It's growing "as fast as average (8%) - [https://www.bls.gov/oes/2017/may/oes191029.htm](https://www.bls.gov/oes/2017/may/oes191029.htm)

3: California, Oregon, and Washington states have a very high demand for Biologists.
Yo good luck getting a job. You can do it
Your hair is pretty great, man. Not gonna lie. I have long hair myself but it's definitely not as cool as yours.

But hey, while I can't help with our whole shitty outlook on science I can tell you that I do value science and scientists. Most people might not understand how valuable what you do is but a lot of us do and we're appalled at what's happening lately.

Anyway, I hope things work out for you. Keep fighting the good fight, brother.
Just because some troglodytes don't see vaule in what you do doesn't mean it's not important. You ARE a crucial part of our society. Keep you chin up! There are many people, myself included, that value people like you! And if all else fails you could try modeling. You are absolutely stunning to look at! 

You have got this! Don't lose hope! I believe in you!
By being in the bioscience field you've already proved that you can learn ANYthing. You're valuable! Keep your head up.
What a badass career. Sounds really interesting and like you get to do meaningful work. Science is important now more than ever... we need more people like you!
Don’t limit your thinking to one country ...maybe time to go international
Pic a passion that you want to pursue as a biologist and just do all that you can because you care! That's all that matters in the end and I bet you will be phenomenal!
at the risk of sounding shallow, you're really damn hot! I love the hair so much! looks like you take good care of it - for which props to you!
I am so sorry that job hunting is hard and I really hope you're gonna find a good job soon! you seem really smart so I'm sure you will manage!
take care! good luck!
Move to another state?
Sorry you’re feeling this way. You’re doing amazing work and I hope that you’ll find a place to live one day that recognizes that. Good luck!
You are beautiful and intelligent. I know there's a lot of other states that would treasure someone of your skills and abilities working there.
The world needs more scientists. Don’t lose hope or give up, we are counting on you.
Well done on being better informed than your own government, hopefully you can escape to somewhere better soon!
love your hair! you clearly take good care of it
I appreciate all the words of encouragement! I do try to stay positive but sometimes it can be a little overwhelming.
Honestly I stopped scrolling because you’re hot. Literally you’re doing the most valued work in the world, FUCK whoever is holding you back.
My degree/career path choices are also not valued, you’re not alone. Keep your chin up, lady. Something will come along and you’re going to rock it so hard. ❤️❤️❤️
Yeah, I unfortunately live in one of those. Not for long, hopefully.
I'm just going to mention this because a lot of people have no idea. A big part of why this guy is having trouble is that under Trump scientific endeavors have fallen off the list of priorities for the government. That's just objectively true. It's not my opinion. He's going to have trouble in any state, probably. I know most people aren't aware of this but look at what's going on with the USDA for example. That's probably the most visible example. This is something everyone should at least know about. Maybe you care and maybe you don't, I don't know, but you really should at least know about it.
Yeah, my plan is to move but the trouble is saving up enough. I have been applying for other states very often though. I didn’t know about those states having a high demand though!
I want to study mycology and get my PhD in it, and that’s the goal that drives me forward. It’s hard to know how to take the first steps though.
This is sadly true.  But I live in a state that already underfunds sciences so it’s even worse.
If you haven't already, the link provided is a good place to start when it comes to viewing the supply and demand of different states
Find someone who studies in mycology and go and ask them some questions!
My Dad is bipolar - has been really healthy for 20 + years. He is a nurse and one of the best I've ever witnessed. He is a kind soul who works his butt off. I'm sure you can do it, it won't be easy, but keep studying, keep working hard, & most importantly don't forget to take care of yourself!
My friend... I see you think your bipolarity is progressing and you feel worse...

You're brave for posting, for seeking help. I think you're beautiful also. And you're definitely smart... You got wit and see things under a light other's don't or can't.

Things will get better. Persevere. Trust yourself and love yourself.

I remember when I cried on my first English class... I got around my fear by reading English jokes! Try to remember what you love about nursing... That will help you keep going.

You can also pm me if you want to keep talking, I know how lonely the world can get sometimes.
Bipolar will not hold you back. You've already committed to something challenging - and presumably that you have a passion for - and come what may, you will rock it.   
Plus, you got style, and an awesome jacket. Winning.
On my first day of nursing school (this past May) I sat in the parking lot before class and cried. Once I got out of class I called my mom and told her I couldn’t do this. 3 months later I’m about to end my first semester and I am so proud of my accomplishments. 

You can do this. It will be tough, but it is doable. Good luck and pm me if you need advice/want to talk about nursing school.
Someone very dear to me is bipolar. Things were very hairy for a while, but this person is now very successful and happy. Don't. Stop. Fighting.

Be open with your loved ones about your struggles, and keep working on finding the treatment  thats going to allow you to live a close to normal life. There is a bearable life out there for those of us with mental health concerns. We just have to lean on each other and get each other through the tough stuff. We KNOW you can do it! Maybe you can't RIGHT NOW, and if that's really the case, that's ok. Your health comes first, friend!

Every job I've taken since college has intimidated me. I struggle with anxiety, depression, and recently diagnosed panic disorder. Together, these ailments give me the feeling that I just can't perform as well as other candidates. Sometimes that's true, but most times it's not. Bipolar is a lot more challenging than what I've got though, and I am so proud of you for trying! 

I don't know how old you are, but at 28, I've had to train myself not to measure my success by the yardstick of other people. Most people your age don't have that extra weight to overcome. Waking up is easy, they sleep and eat normally, and they don't literally get sick with worry over anything. Factor in the extra weight you're pulling and forgive yourself for having to ease up sometimes. 

You're absolutely adorable, by the way, and I hope that something comes your way this week that will make you smile. We all deserve happiness, and you're no exception. Whatever path you take regarding your education, just know that you can find the seeds of success along both. And we're here if you need someone to walk along with you awhile.
It will take more work but you can do anything you put mind too. You are a beautiful young women. The hill is just bigger for some than others.
Grad school pushed me to my limit in so many ways, my anxiety being one of them. You are already making a huge step going to class this afternoon. You will make an amazing nurse, as overwhelmed as you are don’t lose sight of that, you’ve got this!!
Hey you didn’t give up and went back for your other classes. If you decide to take a different path there is no shame in that either. You are also very pretty and I love your bangs though I might be a bit biased because mine are the same. 🙂
As hard as the realization hits you, it's never a failure when you discover what you hoped to do is not your cup of tea. I started off in journalism in University and hated every minute of it. By second year first semester, I couldn't handle it anymore and I went into a semester of limbo after. During that time, I found my passion for history, and now have my Bachelor of Arts in the subject. However, this is just me. 

It's possible you'll get through this semester and realize this isn't what you want to do, but you'll find something you're passionate about. I can't imagine how difficult things are with bipolar, but I have PTSD. I'll admit, it was hard to keep up with studies at times, but there are people on campus who genuinely care, and can help you through. First weeks are always extremely overwhelming, it will take time to adjust. Keep us updated with how things are going. If you need any encouragement, feel free to DM me.

Hello! Fellow bippie here (it's a word I made up, it's fine.)

Normal life and workload is an overwhelming task for us, and our stupid brains will make it worse with taunts and jeers.

Ignore it.

There is one mantra that I've kept in mind whenever I'm having a rough patch

"I am in control."

Our disorders don't define us, they're just a part of us. Tell it who is in charge

Make schedules and keep them. Meditate, be mindful, enjoy your time and your experiences.

You are in control.
u can do it girl. it will be hard but in the end ur gonna be successful and you’ll be proud of how hard u worked. also i like ur septum and freckles hehe
You can. Don’t let it hold you back. Take it one class at a time, one day at a time, one clinical at a time, don’t let it overwhelm you. You’ve got this.
Congratulations on being accepted to Nursing school and choosing a profession of service! 
You have come this far and while nursing school will be hectic, just remember why you chose the profession, take care of yourself and all the rest will work itself out. I’m rooting for you.
I’m bipolar too and from one BP to another, today as you know, can be a completely awesome day.   For people like us there’s no middle ground, I know.   But give it another day.   And another.  Get a week in and reassess.   Try two weeks and compare the two.    You’ve got the brains to be in this program, and you’re quite pretty as well, so this just might be a great thing if you see it through.  One day and one week at a time.   You got this.    ;
Oh girl you’re amazing and you have got this!! I know how much bipolar can hold you back but just take every day as it comes and if need be, go back (or go if you haven’t already) to the doctors and tell them you’re struggling. Don’t let it take over!! I know that’s easier said than done, especially coming from someone who’s having an up day rather than down.

You’re a beautiful, strong woman and your mental health will help you be more relatable once in the nursing profession. Just keep on fighting back.
I went through law school with epilepsy, hardest thing I've ever done. I'd wake up some mornings on the floor 30 minutes before class and had to drag myself to the room to get ready only to arrive late. I never "beat" the epilepsy, but I did learn to over-work it. Try and not think about this in a negative way but rather as a chance to prove to yourself how much you're capable of. You worked hard to get in and you know you're capable of learning it so the only thing that stands in your way is being bipolar. Maybe this is your first real chance to truly overcome!
My sister is a nurse and has bipolar disorder. She completed her nurse's degree and worked as an RN for years. Now she works with plastic surgery patients recovering from other surgeries in an office she loves. She is married, has two kids and two dogs. (OK, the dogs are a little unruly... but I don't think her bipolar is making her give in to the puppy dog eyes every time, lol)

It wasn't easy getting there, but she did it. I wish I could relay to you all of her strategies, but she's pretty sensitive about talking about her diagnosis still and I'm not sure if I could get that out of her in a reasonable time frame... however: Have you looked into whether your school offers any disability programs for mental health diagnoses? Speaking from personal experience, such programs can be extremely helpful to college students: some let you take your tests at different times or by yourself; you can have due dates for projects/homework shifted in response to incidents related to your mental health; and in general, people there are usually able to point you in the direction of more help.

I do know my sister relied heavily on her classmates; I lived with her while she was studying, and I'm pretty sure she went to every group study meet they had. She also stayed on medication prescribed by her psychiatrist all throughout school to help her cope.

Wherever your choices in life lead you, though, I hope you find joy and contentment. Just don't give up before you've given yourself a chance.
Your nose ring is so cute! Its always honna be a hard first day, but imagine if you can get through it like this, with your mental state on hard mode with minimal skill, imagine how good its gonna feel when you're killin it later on! Love the bangs btw!
Dude, I want you to keep going! You're gonna do such great work in this world! Make this into a story about how you overcame adversity and your hard work and dedication paid off!

Also, love your hair!
You're gorgeous.

With that out of the way, I wish you all the luck.  Life is a long journey, take your time and enjoy it. If there's a way to take less classes or shorten your nursing school workload so you can still do it give it a shot. 

Take care Reddit stranger
You got this girl.
I’m bipolar and recently started college. It’s a shock but we’ll do fine. ❤️
You have a sweet kind face that would make a great nurse! 

I have PTSD, depression and anxiety. 
One of the best nurses I know -is my mum! She has bipolar and she’s always done so well in her career 

Wishing you the best x x
Your mental illness is doing the only thing bullies know how to do: make you feel small. This one lives in your brain, so it knows how to hit you where it hurts. Don’t let it win. You were smart enough to get yourself here, and you’re smart enough to graduate and become a kickass, genius, healer of humans. Imagine the young people you will inspire when you beat your brain bully’s  ass and triumph despite its best efforts. Imagine how accomplished you’ll feel. Imagine all the people you’ll help- probably some with the same mental illness you have. You. Can. Do. This. The world needs you.
You got it! The first few weeks are always the hardest. If you can get through the first 100 days you will be fine and will finish! (That’s an actual thing we use in higher ed, if we can support students for their first 100 days and they are doing good they will graduate). Also if you are diagnosed with bipolar please go to your schools disability services and let them help you get accommodations. They can do things like give you more time for assignments/tests, quiet testing, and more. You got this! Also college professors are so much more understanding than you think. Just make sure you communicate with them, you don’t have to tell them everything that’s going on but if they are aware something is going on they will work with you. 

Also create a google calendar with all of your assignments, classes, and tests. It will help you remember what you need to complete and help make it more manageable.

Good luck! You are going to do great!
You look EXACTLY like an amazing nurse I know, except she has silver hair. Maybe, just maybe she was a time traveler from the future that got so good at nursing she came back in time to use her skills where it was most needed
I’m in your shoes girl. Nursing school with mental illness is so hard, but damn is it rewarding. Give it some time, maybe even go to student disability to see if they can do anything to help with your condition. Please let me know if you ever need to talk! I’m almost a senior in nursing school and it’s scary but I’m so glad I stuck with it.
Hi friend ❤️ I’m not in nursing nor do I have bipolar, but I have pretty severe OCD and anxiety and am studying pre-medicine. I remember my first week of classes I had a complete breakdown, because this shit is FUCKING HARD. It’s something that many people go through and persevere through, and there is also zero shame in changing your path if that is what will be best for you. No education is wasted if it brings you to your eventual life  :) I have had luck facing it with humor and professional help! 

I wish you all the best in pursuing your dreams and reaching those goals no matter what they are and become! 

You have such a strong gaze and your strength is shining through your picture. Feel free to pm me if needed!
I thought this was “RoastMe” and thought everyone was being really supportive and kind to what will be the next generation of healthcare professionals.

You’ve got this! Don’t you let anything hold you back!
Hey. The perception of the workload is just a thing...don't panic, try and be calm and assess the situation calmly and day to day.
I cried most days during my first week in nursing school because it was so much work (and I’m a guy!). However, I finished nursing school this December and I’m so glad I stuck it out. I encourage you to do the same, not because I finished it, but because I believe that you can do it!
I know I’m late to the encouragement party, but I brought gifts!! (It’s just a little wisdom, don’t get too excited, lol) 

I’m sorry you felt overwhelmed (possibly still do) but the most important thing to remember there is there is a huge difference between feeling overwhelmed and being incapable. I have the very fun cycle of triggering anxiety, bipolar, and cPTSD, and I’m in my last year of my pre-med program. 

The amount of times I have cried, thought of giving up, been soo anxious that I literally just sat in my driveway with my car in neutral unable putting it in any gear are obscene in retrospect. I still have about a severe enough episode to keep me from getting to class once every 3-4 months, and when they come about, I email my professors and just stop to take the time I need (usually a week). The reason I mentioned that there is a difference between ability and a sense of being overwhelmed, is that is what kept me going back. Even when the week wasn’t long enough to completely recover, it was always enough to build up enough resolve to remind me that the backlog would be worse if it built up beyond that, and I’m more than capable of catching up on a weeks worth of work (communicating with your professor/instructor is critical, most will respond and are willing to work with you even if you tell them you won’t be in touch until you see them in lecture/lab when you come back). 

Someone mentioned going to disability services, that probably the best move you can make. Having an AOD (Accommodation Of Disability) on record makes sure that when you’re struggling, you basically have a promise from the school that they’re not going to penalise you for it, and will instead accommodate you. Take it easy on yourself, do the best you can and you can do it. 

You’re capable, just overwhelmed, making that distinction will help a lot (I hope 😊). You’re awesome for pursuing a goal of any kind given how crippling bipolar disorder can be, be proud of that, and trust in whatever gave you the strength to even attempt to rise above it. 

Also, I’m older than everyone else in my program by about a decade, and the workload is certainly heavier than I expected, but I’m kicking ass and you can too!! If an antisocial, emotionally stunted and struggling old fogey like me can do it, a badass like you can too. Chin up, and feel free to pm me if you need someone to listen, or advise.
My mom always told me this:

“Look, if all of those other kids can do this class, so can you. You are just as smart as the rest of them, so go be where you belong.”

Idk why but It always helped

Good luck! Youre gonna be a great nurse! Stick with it Kiddo! :-)
It will work out at the end ! Trust me you will be able to do it if you stick with it. I’m a guy that’s barley cried but starting uni and taking classes for econ got me crying in the bathroom . But not I’ve passed some of the hardest ones. These are all tests that challenge your willpower and knowledge , they break you and many people don’t get it . I believe in you :)
You’re stronger than you give yourself credit for, don’t give up! You’ll find your flow in time.
I’m in nursing school (only you don’t call it nursing school in Australia) and I have anxiety and depression and a fun little inclination toward substance abuse. The fact that you’ve chosen to study nursing shows that you’re someone who cares deeply about helping others and having a meaningful life (as well as having serious job security, at least here), and that shit is important! Best of luck, you can do this ❤️
You look like the girl from Bonding (Netflix) and she's a badass.
First days always the hardest, and I can tell you’ve got what it takes just from the fact you’re going back ❤️ 

You’re also a stupid amount of pretty so if you ever get sick of nursing, you’ve got modelling to fall back on 😉
You are putting yourself out there and I'm really proud of you for that. If I can be honest, life is not gonna be easy. It will be hard. But if you push through , the rewards will be amazing! Trust me :)
It seems really hard in the beginning, I felt the same with university, but they have supports in place to help, try taking a look to see what your school has for disability support. They can be the nicest people and will be your best friends.

You’ve survived your life in until now and let me say you look awesome, you’ll survive this. My nana always used to say and now my mom does too: “this too shall pass” meaning that some day soon this anxiety about handling the work load and even the work kid will pass you’ll have done it, it can just be hard to get there, but you will! You’ve got this!
You can do this!!!  Don't give up before you've even started!

Even if you struggle, you are still doing the damn thing! 

Be open with your friends, and even be open with your professors if you feel like you are struggling! Most professors want to see the best out of each student, even if it means making accommodations! Your bipolarity will only help you in the healthcare field, you'll be able to connect easier and have more understanding of your patients!

&#x200B;

(PS, your makeup looks awesome!)
It's normal to feel overwhelmed beginning a new course!!! I'm obviously less aware of your abilities than you are, but I don't think many people go into nursing and feel like it's going to be easy. I'd bet 3/4 of your class feels overwhelmed right now.


It is very likely you CAN do this, but if you know for certain you can't do it, that's also ok! A lot of people could not be nurses, it's a really hard job, there is no shame in changing what you're doing if you have to.


Good on you for wanting to help others as your vocation.  If you can't do it, the next step is finding something similarly satisfying for your kind heart (working with children, seniors, plants, people with addictions etc.)


Often people with their own problems are the kindest helpers, it's a superpower you can get from suffering if you work it right. All the best to you, whichever you choose.
You know that chick from NCIS? The quirky lab girl with the outlandish hair? The fan favorite?  


You look like her, but more responsible.
You're beautiful and you're educating yourself to be able to help others and be a productive member of society. You're a great person. You're strong and you can do this!
Your eyeliner is on point 👌 Although I can’t completely relate to your situation, every time I start a new semester the work seems overwhelming and I freak out a little. But I just try to take it one step, one assignment, at a time and by the end I’m amazed at the work I did! Hang in there, you’ve got it.
I’m so sorry you had a hard day. I remember how overwhelming the first day of classes can be, especially when you are struggling with mental illness. 

I want to tell you that you have come this far and you are so strong for going to that second class. I’m so proud of you and you are resilient and capable. You also showed that you are committed to success because you reached out for encouragement. 

I’m proud of you and I wish you all the best. You can do this! You are amazing!
The little heart you drew at the bottom speaks a lot about you. I hope you get better my friend. Trust me, you got this. Good luck.
You have a very sweet face and you remind me so much of the nurse who did my 18m daughter’s intake a few months ago. I was having a meltdown and so was the baby, and she was cool, calm, collected, and most importantly soothing. My kiddo is a spitfire and this woman handled her so gracefully while I held her and cried. I couldn’t even describe the doctor to you, but I still remember the three nurses names (we were in the ER for a really long time). The nurses are the backbone and I’m so thankful. 

Your bipolar doesn’t define you - and you can change lives for the better!
Your really pretty and cute and I love your piercings, your doing great and I believe that you can keep going but remember it's ok if you can't
I’m going to nursing school soon and i have anxiety. We will do it and we will do it well! You absolutely will succeed! ❤️
Sounds like you have great empathy, nurses need that and we need you!!you got this!!!
Don't ever not keep in mind the completely bad ass you that is at the other side of this challenge.  She's waiting for you.  Stay strong.  You can do this.
Feel empowered to reach out when you need to
Hey, I know it’s a lot. Especially Chem, Micro and the anatomy classes. It’s so much memorization and it seems so scary. I’m taking nursing too, and dealing with some health stuff. I don’t have your exact situation but I know what you mean when you say how daunting the load seems when you have a condition like bipolar. Personally, I’m taking one class in the summer and only three per semester. Not a full work load at all. It’s much easier to handle. It’ll take longer to complete the degree but it’s safer for my body and easier on my mental health. Is there a way you can decrease your courseload to be less than full-time? Or are you required to be full-time for the degree? I’ve also found that for classes where I have to memorize a ton of things, making flashcards helps me remember the material. Good luck, sugar. You can do this.
Growth is painful. You've never been this version of yourself. So give yourself some grace, and breathe through it. You will find your balance : ) I'm rooting for you girl!
I know it feels stressful but stick with it for a couple weeks. I am a nursing student as well and was a CNA for years on an Alzheimer’s unit. My first two weeks on that unit were absolutely the most stressful, scary weeks of my life. I cried and said “i don’t think i can do this job” after i got used to the routine of things it became the best job I’ve ever had! Take care of yourself and lay out a plan..once you’re in a comfortable routine you can thrive! If not, that’s ok too. There are millions of paths to take! 

Also, i adore your look. Very gorgeous
I have schizophrenia and like four other mental disorders, including depression. Your not alone. :)
No matter how rough things get, don’t ever quit!  Seek the help and resources to get you through, but realize that the time will pass anyway whether you’re in nursing school or not.  Hang in—- you can do anything for a couple years (and NOBODY likes nursing school, I know).  The payout— massive job availability and good pay has allowed me to fully indulge my hobbies and have enough money to do some traveling.  Keep those beautiful eyes on the prize!  You got this!
It can seem overwhelming but you got this. Just take it one day at a time. Build your support system. Friends, family, meds, therapy, and hobbies will help get you through this. Also, feel free to stop by r/bipolar if you haven't already. It's a really great sub and everyone is incredibly supportive and nonjudgemental. Sending positive vibes your way!
You are so beautiful, and I’m sure you have already proven to yourself you are strong, and can do scary things. I know our brains can try and tell us lies and it’s really hard to step over them, but remember all the times you have succeeded, and proven your bipolar brain wrong, write them down and keep them with you. Although I believe in you, It is also okay if you realize you don’t want to be a nurse, and it’s okay if you keep going to school and in a year realize you don’t want to be a nurse. The universe wants you to be where you are please try not to stress about the future, I know it is easier said than done.
Nursing is a very selfless and kind career to pursue, so first off MASSIVE RESPECT to people like you, future nurses, past nurses, present nurses etc. You will do a lot of good things and help a lot of people! And knowing that you could do that on top of handling your bipolar would make you indestructible. You got this, friend. Good luck! (You're doing great!!!!)
Hugs.
As someone who had diagnosed PTSD after an accident, and depression and am now medicine free preschool teacher.

Don't let it dictate your life. You are not defined by a disease, you are defined by yourself and your actions. Do what you can to make the best you OP.

Don't let it pull you down, adapt and overcome, you can figure out how to live and do your nursing, if nursing is what you love, you'll find a way to overcome any obstacles.
Hey, I'm so sorry your first day got off to this kind of start. I also dealt with mental illness while getting through school (different field but also a crazy workload). It's not easy but it's doable, particularly if you can communicate with your teachers and/or advisor when you're struggling. They want you to succeed, and if they can they'll often be willing to work with you to make that happen. I went to my teachers on more than one occasion when I needed additional time or alternative assignment options and they were great about it. I'd also recommend being in good contact with your doc and/or therapist and keeping that as a priority. You are brave and strong for entering a nursing program, and for putting yourself out there in this post. You can do this if it's what you want.
I moved to get my PhD and cried my very first class. I thought, "I moved my family to get a PhD and I think I made a mistake." Turns out, it wasn't a mistake but those experiences are hard. 

Also, as a person who is a faculty member who also works with other faculty, nursing faculty are among the most heartfelt, genuine people on this earth. Reach out. Tell them how you are feeling. They will work with you. Maybe you don't take as many courses, but don't drop out if this is your goal. They will help you figure things out. They are very understanding and have the biggest hearts of any faculty out there.
Your make-up is beautiful! You look like you could be some kind of forest elf.
Be proud of yourself and the effort you make. Every time you put your shoes on and go to that class, you're making progress. Keep in mind, even baby steps are progress.
Hang in there and I think everything will work out. Please remember that, even in the worst case scenario if you are not able to finish nursing school, you will still have attained many other unforeseen accomplishments as long as you try your best. Wish you the best!
I hope you will be okay! Have a similar problem so maybe its nice to know you are not alone on this. I think eventually it will be clear what you will be doing if you do what feels right for you. All the best
You can totally do it!!! You got this shit yo. 
On an unrelated note... you are VERY attractive.. so you got that going for you, which is nice.
As a fellow bipolar, I understand the feeling that our illness can hold us back. Sometimes it will and sometimes it won't. Either way, in this situation, I'm proud of you for trying and encourage you to keep going. I'm currently doing that with a job I strongly dislike.

And if you find nursing isn't for you (whether because of the illness or any other reason), it's not the end of the world (even if it feels like if is). We keep getting up and kick ass as best we can! A fulfilling life *is* out there for you!

Also, you have really nice skin and I'm a bit jealous! Haha.
You got this. It’s just the first day I’m sure it feels overwhelming, but I bet everyone else feels just like you do.  Just fake it till you make it. Tell yourself you will show up and listen and take notes.  Just keep doing that.  Next thing you know you will have adjusted and you’ll see you can handle this.  

If you got into nursing school despite your bipolar, you can certainly handle sitting in a class and learning.  Have faith in yourself!
Trust me beauty, you can do this. I know things can feel impossible when you’re at the bottom of the mountain. All you need to do is take one tiny step per day. That’s it. At the end of a week, you’ll be up a foot. At the end of the month, you’ll have climbed higher than you are tall. Imagine where you’ll be in a year! 

We are in desperate need of nurses who truly, deeply understand the mental health challenges that many people face. You will make an enormous difference in the life of your patients and your families. You wouldn’t give up on them, so don’t give up on yourself. 

I’m proud of you for reaching out to get a boost. Remember that you don’t have to do this or anything else in your life alone.
Good luck! You can do it. It always helps me to remember that motivation is fleeting and generally only comes after discipline has been there for a while. Then after that I break things into manageable sized chunks and I take lots of mini breaks and just get to work. Things will be great!
I have BPD & schizotypal personality disorder & I’m in my third year of court reporting school, which has a dropout rate of 90%. You. Can. Do. This. These things may always be harder for those of us with mental disorders, but it doesn’t mean we are any less capable. I have all the faith in the world that you can not just get through nursing school, but you will also kick ass in it!!

Edit: You are freaking gorgeous & I’m jealous of your face!
The best is yet to come.
You can do it. You're not the only one who has ever dealt with it and made it to the otherside and you won't be the last. Just take some deep breaths, the road is long but you'll get there. Now chin up, go be that badass you know you are and crush these classes!
You got this! Don’t let anything hold you back!
Give it your best and live in the moment.
Don’t let bipolar hold you back. You’re capable of more than you think. It may be a difficult journey but in the end you’ll be proud of yourself and what you’ve accomplished.
Bipolar is tough. Make sure you are taking care of yourself. Get enough sleep, take your meds if you have them, eat enough. You got this. In a couple years you will be posting on here about how much of an impact you made that day and how much you love your job. I know you will get there.
One day at a time.  Do everything you can every day and see what shakes out.  Don't stress about doing more than what's possible.

Also, go kick ass and figure it out.
Keep moving forward my friend!
Sending prayers
The first day is probably scary for everyone! I believe you will be an excellent nurse because your bipolar is also as of yet unrecognized super power!  You will learn how to use it!
You can do it! A lot of us nurses have mental health issues. It's ok. Push through. I believe in you.
You can do it! 1 step at a time
You can do it!!
I just finished my first of 3 years of nursing school. If being a nurse is something you're really passionate about, and you study hard, no mental disorder can get in your way. YOU CAN DO THIS! GO GET 'EM!
You got this!
I really dig your hair, and I'm kinda jealous of the septum ring because I couldn't possibly pull one off with my garbage deviated septum. I hope you get to feeling better, and can get things figured out.
Former nursing student here- after about two semesters I realized I couldn't handle the workload due to my chronic migraines and severe anxiety and depression. I switched my major to Biology and got into Parks and Recreation (the career path and the tv show) and now I'm the park director for a small government agency. The pay is good, the benefits are outstanding, and I work 8 to 4 every day. Things always work out the way they are supposed to! Message me if you want to chat about it!
Ok...first off, you are stronger than you think. Right now you are thinking too far ahead and getting overwhelmed. Stop doing that. Do one thing at a time and focus on just that thing. The first day of nursing school is horrible. I got so overwhelmed I almost quit. But my therapist told me to only focus on the next thing that needed doing and nothing else. I got through four years of school successfully and you can too!!! You got this! Go kick some ass now!
You got this far!! You can absolutely do it!! Intimidating? Hell yes!  But impossible? No way and your going to change so many peoples live that are in your exact position later! Congratulations!!!
Nursing school! That is a wonderful thing to do and honestly to give up your time and decide that you want to spend your life helping others at their worst makes you one of the best people alive. Well done to you! 

And then your determination in the face of opposition, to make sure that you can go on and help people makes you one of the kindest and most awe-inspiring people around! Go you!
My first thought was about how well the makeup on your eyes (mascara?) is done! I love the wings! Despite being a girl, I have literally no idea how to use makeup (my makeup phase lasted like a week when I was 8, so I didn't learn much) and it really impresses me when I see nice-looking makeup. Wings are my fave! Good job.
You’ve got this - you eat an elephant one bite at a time, right? You might need a few more bites to eat your elephant, but you can still do it. Give yourself credit for getting to where you are, and take it one step at a time.

You’ve got this!
Wow. Hi there, lovely! Fellow Bipolar gal, fellow Nursing student :) 

I think many of the most compassionate people are driven to pursue nursing as a profession. Sure, the workload is intense, and yes, it will be hard. Some days you will wanna scream and pull your hair out. But some days make it all worth it, and those moments are what remind you why you took this path in the first place. Now I definitely won't tell you what to do, as you know best and should trust your gut instinct; but for now I'd encourage you to keep at it. The first year is the most difficult (I'm in my second currently, trust me it improves!)

Wishing you the best of luck in any endeavor you decide. Don't forget to put yourself and your mental health first. Love to you!
Don't give up yet, maybe lighten the work load? What's the rush? You can work at your pace, it's not a race. You'll get there when you're ready. PS. I love your look, you're adorable.
It's awesome that you know your limits. :) Make sure that it actually is a limit and not just anxiety but if that's the case then work with that. You know what you can and cant do so act accordingly. There is NO shame in taking fewer classes if they are over whealming for you. I'm fortunate are enough to not have to deal with anything more than some pretty generic social anxiety and there are semesters where I end up taking just one or two serious classes and then focus on basic GE or PE to get myself up to the unit count I need. It is far better to take fewer classes and need an additional semester even if that means needing to find more financial aid than to take too many, try and force it, fail, and then not be eligible for financial aid. 

You know your limits and that is a BIG deal and impressive. Trust yourself. :) If you're going into nursing you're a smart cookie and deserve to be trusted even if  it's (and possibly especially) by yourself. 

Also, you said that it's your first day of nursing school (and congradulations for getting into that! That's no mean feat in and of itself and deserves some recognition!). Be aware things that sound and start scary often get easier. I'm in engineering and am HORRIBLE at math. I literally started college in remedial where I had to relearn PEMDAS and was dreading calculus and honestly it was as bad as I feared. But here I am still kicking away and I'm about a year out of graduating. I've taken a lot of hits in my classes but have managed to tough it out and I'm confident that if you trust yourself and dont try and force yourself to work by someone else's schedule that you'll make it and do fine.

You got this!
Maybe a different toast approach (approast?) but you look like you have really good music taste and like we could talk for a long time about it. Good luck with school I hope you do well <3
My therapist is bipolar and she's fantastic because she *actually* gets it. Whatever you do, you'll be better able to understand people's needs because of your neurodivergency.
The fact that you are going back to class is huge. Good luck. And your bangs are killer.
You seem like such a kind, gentle and caring soul. The world needs more people like this in nursing. Be kind and caring to yourself. Go at your own pace and believe in yourself.
I can't say I know what you're feeling, because I don't. But I believe that you'll be able to do this, so keep trying! You'll get through this 😁
Hugs, maybe they have a pt option for students with disabilities or medically supported rationale.  Never hurts to ask.  School is hard work and a lot of people are really understanding of the stress that comes with it.  More hugs, good for you for all the hard work you have already done!  Maybe a different program still in medical field might be your calling/suite you better?
It's easier said than done but don't let one part of your personality dictate the direction of your life. You made it this far which means you had to work hard, this will be more demanding but you're capable of it. Now go out there and give it hell!!
Just the fact that you are trying to help others, despite your own difficulties says a million things of you.   
For most of my life I have been in contact with nurses and caretakers in different capacities.   
(My father has been wheelchair bound since I was 5 years old.)   


The job can be hard at times, but know that the people you help will love you with all their hearts for you doing it, despite that some may find it difficult to show it to you.   


And in terms of jobs, with the degrees you are getting there are loads of directions you can go!   
There are heavy workload jobs, like working in first aid, but then there are degrees down as well. And any patient you help will appreciate everything you do.   


I hope you learned a lot during your second class!   


Keep at it! You can do it.   
Too many people look down on that profession, but for me, you are a hero. Just like you will be for all the people you will help in your life! :)
My girlfriend is bipolar and got through her classes. I think you'll be fine.

I am not saying it will be easy, as it wasn't easy for her, but she did get through it and I am sure you can too

Edit: You're really pretty, btw.
I can't imagine what it's like being bipolar. I've known people who were, one of my cousins is even, and I still can't imagine living with it, but I think you can do anything you put your mind to. It'll be rough, but you're an intelligent woman and you're amazing to get this far. I also love your style!
Don't worry you got this.
Try your next class and see if you can get through it. Keep doing that for each class. Conquer them 1 at a time.
Hang in there, nursing gives you purpose greater than yourself. Talk to your doctor about adjusting the meds to help with the new life stressors and throw yourself into your school. If nursing isn't for you because it's just not your thing? That's ok too. Good luck kiddo. Your going to do great things.
Someone once told me something I'll never forget: rest, don't quit.

Also, you're so beautiful! Those bangs looks so great on you! I really wish I could wear bangs too, but few people can actually pull them off. I love those piercings too. You look badass!
You're what strength looks like. Upvote x infinity
If you need time to help yourself mentally then give it to yourself. No matter what the result is, remember that you are worth the self care and that’s it’s better to live life with happiness even if you don’t always get what u want
It’s natural to feel overwhelmed by a new course of study, and even with your being bipolar, you’re good enough!
Girl, I can’t speak to being bipolar, but I think you’re amazing for sticking to it and working on your dreams. Please utilize your school’s mental health resources. They are there to help you succeed!!
You can do this. And doing it will give you SO much more self respect and confidence. I just completed 2+ years of school to become an x-ray technologist (similar course load and clinical schedule to nursing) and, although it was very difficult, I could not be happier with myself. If I can do it (I won't even go into all my stuff) you can do it! It always seems so daunting and impossible at first. But it gets so much better once you get a grasp on how things will really go. Show yourself what you're capable of!!!!
You will get used to it
It’s overwhelming but don’t give up! You can do this. The fact that you are going back for classes even after this happened says SO much. You got this girl!
Girl those eyebrows! 😍
You can def do it 

I know lots of RNs - it’s hard but you’ll get there
Check with your school’s academic counsellors about accommodations that will help you be successful.  Most colleges and universities happily accommodate students’ special needs and you’re entitled to the help.  

I’m proud that you’re going back for your afternoon class, even when the morning was overwhelming.  That’s amazing, even if it doesn’t feel that way right now!
It's not easy, but you can do more than you think that you can. It takes time to get used to a new routine. You will find that it gets easier when you adjust to your new routine. 
I said a prayer for you!
Dem eyes ♥️
Good you figured it out before you wasted money and time. It’s excellent you know who you are. This coupled with your incredible appearance, You will go far. Enjoy your journey!
Bipolar nurse here! Try it out and see how it goes. Your mental health is #1, and nursing can be very demanding and stressful. But I’m an LVN and I work in a hospice company and my job is chill and awesome. 

If you’re in an RN program and it’s too much, maybe LVN is better for you. 


But if you really want it, do it. Just see how it goes! Don’t get overwhelmed and tell yourself it now or never and this or nothing. Because you have a lot of options.  Give yourself some time to acclimate and if you want to try something else, it’s all good. But nursing can be awesome and fun, it doesn’t have to be crazy busy and stressful. ❤️❤️


Forgot to add, talk to your psychiatrist/therapist about it and get their opinion and ask for ideas for coping mechanisms and what to do when feeling overwhelmed. Life is great even with BD. I am living proof. Much love.
Hang in there love. Cheering for you!
You got this.
You can do anything you put your mind to girl! I believe in you! Ps love your ear piercings
From your post history you seem like you’ve got a great sense of humour. :)
There’s nothing wrong with trying something and having yourself think it’s not for you, it’s the first day and maybe after you acquire the knowledge it will become easier. And on the flip side of you don’t enjoy it, you absolutely don’t have to stick to it! You’re a strong woman . Don’t forget that. :)
Give it time, you’ve already come this far :)
I'm sorry you're having a rough time.  Sometimes a bad first day is just a bad first day, and all it means is the universe is pushing your limits and making you stronger.  Don't give up, but remember that whatever you decide is the right thing to do, there are people around you to help and support you.

Hope your second class is better than the first. Good luck!
Since when can bipolar people not do homework or write essays? You can do it girl!!!! They make it hard to weed people out
You can do this. It's going to be really challenging and you may need some help, but you CAN do this!!
Im sure you can do it! And also, your style.. wow
The first day is always overwhelming. No matter what classes. Don’t give up. Give yourself a chance. The more you try the less it will pressure you. Don’t let your bipolar boss you around. I had to learn that with my depression. You can do it. Maybe if you take it a little slower at first it would help. My prayers are with you.
Yo you are gonna be fine my dude, words don't immediately solve the problem but it seems you got a whole lotta love comin' from the community so good luck and you got this.
You got this!
Just keep going.
Ur hot
There are over 153 comments on this post. Not sure if you're going to read this particular one but I have to tell you that you're very beautiful :) 

Also I would love to chat if you'd be interested in a 23 year old computer science undergraduate from Pakistan
damn she's hot
You are beautiful!
You are very beautiful and I believe in you and I think you will be a very good nurse and the bipolarism will doesn't be an obstacle if you think then you are stronger (sory if I have a bad English)
Good luck
You remind me of Abby from NCIS.

I think you should run with that, get some fuckoff-huge stompey boots and walk all over those classes. You made it through your first day. That's huge. You'll handle the next day even better.

Never forget: you are the culmination of evolution. Your very being is proof that you are one of the biggest badasses in existence. You have defeated every challenge that life has ever thrown at you, and you have come out on top of *all* of them. Your obstacles are a mountain that you stand at the peak of, and here you are, just looking for a new one to conquer.

You are a magic skeleton made of stardust and powered by electricity. Your reach is already vast, and there is *nothing* beyond your grasp.
A nursing course will be difficult as you know, but the biggest part of the workload is all the required reading.
With bipolar, I imagine the meds sap you of mental energy.
Be sure to register with your special needs department for assistance. They may be able to arrange accommodations that will make your workload a little more bearable.
It will be difficult, but stick to your meds, get enough sleep and be sure to eat a proper diet.
If you pace yourself, you should be able to do it.
Just the fact you chose this field of study makes me proud of you.
You are a very kind man, Andrew.
Thanks man I really needed to hear this today
Also, feel free to message me if you wanna talk bips stuff.

And r/bipolar and r/bipolar2 are both great.
Thanks man
Thanks man ❤️
Thankyou I really needed this today
You best believe I'm gonna go back in my black Steel caps and make this shit work!
Can confirm. He's the kind of person we need more of and one of the only male redditors who has PMd me and has not been a creep. 

And I concur with his statement. And I think you can do this, OP. 

I think also you should go to disability services and see if there's anything they can do to help you as well and get in touch with the campus counseling center if you're not already set up with a therapist. Bipolar is also often responsive to medication, so if you're not trying that avenue, maybe now is the time. Or maybe it's time for a change in meds if your disorder is unaffected. 

Getting ahead of your disorder in this way will be a way of preparing for it and hopefully, ultimately not letting it get the better of you. I struggled and still do struggle with school due to mental illness. I'm in grad school now, have Major Depressive Disorder. Generalized Anxiety Disorder, PTSD  and Borderline, and on top of all that am homeless right now and have been for the better part of a year. And I know that's different. Bipolar is hard and it's debilitating in a way my disorders are not. But I want you to know it is possible. It's very hard. It takes mad dedication. But you're already dedicated if you want to be a nurse, I bet. 

And finally, you're beautiful! You look like a caring person and I'd be happy if you came into my room as my nurse. I'd feel relaxed immediately just because you give off a calm, sweetheart vibe. 

Good luck! And dont forget to post in a few years showing us all that diploma. ♡♡♡
Anytime bud. I think it’s incumbent on us, who’ve the experience, to impart the wisdom we’ve accumulated over the course of our travails. Just internalise your awesomeness (easier said than done, I know), and I’m sure you’ll surprise yourself with how capable you are.
Fuckin right you are! You've got a cheerleader over here. :)
You're so nice u/sylvanwhisper! OP is an amazing person! She said some of the best words of wisdom to me (who was trying to cheer her up) and I ended up being encouraged by her.

I'm just respectful. You know I did have a ldr gf who I met here... So... I think there's a place for flirting also! But not when someone's feeling blue!
You might feel shaky, but you're looking sharp as a razor. That old school cool vibe isn't something everyone can pull off. You rock it well.
You look wonderful already, think how wonderful you will look and *feel* with a bit more weight on you. One thing I have really learned in the last couple of months is that a couple extra pounds wont mean the difference between others loving you or not, others thinking you are attractive or not, etc, etc

I really recommend Huel, has really helped me to stop freaking out about my meals and gain some weight from my anorexia. 

All my best xxx
I'm so proud of you! Your journey is your own but so many people you don't know love and support you for real. Good luck with your body image and please know the work is worth it.
You look amazing, and smartly dressed too! I'm trans too, so I know it's tough, but I think you can get through it with some style and elegance. :)
Totally dig your look, friend.

Your picture made me smile.

Have a good week.

Sending love, happiness, and encouragement.

Cheers.
I can tell you’re a super cool person! Hang in there. The world has amazing things in store for you. It’s a good idea to keep working on your health so you can meet all those opportunities head on. Proud of you!
I love the hat! I could never pull that off, but you sure rock it. Recovering from eating disorders is tough and there’s a lot of uncomfortable emotions involved, but keep your head up! You got this ❤️
Absolutely stunnung! You look fantastic, you're thinking positive, you're trying your best, and you're absolutely gorgeous, you don't need us, but thanks for giving us a chance to try and help! Stay out there and keep on keepin on.
I love your outfit
I like your style, I feel strong English vibe in it!!!

I you truly want something you'll get it. Focus on what matter for you and believe in yourself
Your style is amazing. Recovery is always the best thing and I am so glad you are currently on track. Don’t let your fears hold you back, you are so strong and can make it through this. We all believe in you!
Tyvm, no one has told me that before! I dont dress like this all the time but sometimes it’s nice to wear a vest
Tysm! I’ve been finally gaining weight the past 2-3 weeks and I’m definitely starting to feel a lot better! I do fear that people will stop respecting/loving me if I gain weight, so ty for the reassurance
Ty! I’m trying to relearn that I’M worth it, that I’m worth working on
Ty so much, that means a lot to me. Trans solidarity!
Ty for well wishes~ I’m glad I made someone smile
Ty this is a hopeful thing to say. I’m always scared that my future is going to go downhill and be full of bad thinfs but I try to tell myself I don’t know that
Tysm for the encouragement <3
Tyvm!
Ty I’m glad people seem to love it
Ty, I’m so overcome that people like my outfit, itms one of my favorites! 

Yeah I’m trying to find things that matter to me and worth living for
Ty! Recovery IS the best thing, I’m starting to come around to that
Yeah! \*Sends internet hugs!\*
It’s easy to think about bad things more than good things. There will always be some bad things, but you’ve always gotten through it so far. You can take everything you’ve been through and turn it into your fuel for a brighter future. Good things will happen, no matter what.
Anytime! Hope your day is going good.
I'll let you in on a little secret, your professors are just as nervous and scared an unsure of themselves as you are. I remember my first meeting with other profs before I taught my first class and even professors with decades under their belts admitted they sometimes feel like impostors. So if you ever feel overwhelmed and wonder if you belong just know that even the double doctorates with 40 years of teaching under their belts sometimes feel the same way. You are obviously a pretty young woman with a lovely smile. You will make friends and memories, and while you might always have these doubts just know that they are normal.
You should be looking forward to uni. It's a chance for a new start. Think of the new friends you are going to make and all the clubs you could join. Chin up and dont be afraid to try new clubs.
Hello, beautiful!

Don't worry about uni. You will be able to make it through. It's normal to feel scared and insignificant, but you will find something that you excel at, and you will find friends!

And let me fill you in on  a secret: Don't compare yourself to your peers. No one on this planet actually knows what the hell they are doing, chances are that any good things that you have seen happen have been luck. Or exaggerated. 

Oh, and keep in mind that even if your friends do have big accomplishments, that in NO WAY negates yours. 

Keep your head up.
Uni is a great place to start new or build on yourself in ways you never knew were possible! It’s hard to see your good qualities when the negative self talk starts blabbing, but you really are not an evil worthless person I promise! You have a fantastic smile! You’re about to embark on a new part of life and learn and grow and change so quickly! Your early 20s are so much fun and so hectic and interesting so embrace it :) I hope you have a great week and a fantastic time in school!
You look super cute, and I hope you have a great time at uni. Where you going?
Thank you for that💚
I'm going to be part of a marching band for the first time... I'm so scared because I've never done it before, but I'm excited. ❤️
Thank you so much ❤️ ❤️❤️
You're welcome! I hope you have a great day :)
Ma'am you are a beautiful, wonderful, nurturing woman who should be treated like gold.  You deserve to be loved and to experience true happiness.  You need not feel any culpability in the dissolution of your relationship.  He fulfills the criteria of a narcissist and a user and it sounds like he has little interest in changing.  You're a kind-hearted person and your father just have been a wonderful man to have raised such an equally wonderful daughter.  You deserve to fulfill your dreams and to be accompanied by someone who loves and cherishes, rather than someone who abuses alcohol and blames you for all of his shortcomings.
Forgive me, but I crept through your post and comment history because sometimes it can be hard to give a genuine toast based on one picture.

I want to tell you that I think you are incredibly resilient. Life has its ups and downs for everyone but some of the battles you have fought in the last few years can’t have been easy. Yet everything you post has an air of optimism and really shows you to be an intelligent and caring person. Those are some of the best qualities anyone can hope to have and you have them. Many people let lesser things ruin them but you have kept going strong despite some personal hardships. I really admire that about you.

Keep your head up, there’s no doubt in my mind that you are a positive influence on the people around you and the world. You aren’t a quitter and this internet stranger is rooting for you to make it through this rough patch and on to happier days. They are coming. You are a strong woman

Also, for what it’s worth I think you continue to get more beautiful with passing time. You have a good sense of style and a beautiful smile. The nose ring is super cute and I’m all guy, I don’t know much about hair and eyebrows and stuff like that but even I know yours is on point.
Your smile is intimidatingly stunning and that shirt is 🔥. Also your eyebrow game is on point.
You seem huggable. Like the person you meet at a friends place, where you spend 12 hours just talking about... cucumbers? I don't know. Then a nail? Anyway, you got a personality that shines through a picture, and that's rare. You rock
You're freaking gorgeous!! Hope things get better ❤️
Through those eyes I see a sweet, strong woman.
Things are usually tough and wild in people's 20's, but if you stay tough and keep making good decisions, everything generally falls into place after a while.  Good luck with things!
You are a beautiful woman. You have a great smile and I bet full on would light up any room. Keep your chin stay positive and things will get better. Come see us if you need some further encouragement 🌹
I can comment on how attractive you are, but I am pretty sure you are well aware of just how much you brighten the day of others with your physical appearance.

On the note of your troubles young lady, feel free to post on r/advise or on here if you ever need someone to talk to about what's keeping you down. As often times just having someone who is willing to listen and relate is enough to make all the difference.
Hang in there. Better times are ahead. You’re a stunning woman.
Your hair 😍
That shirt is just like your smile - killer! You also have amazing hair, that's a very rich and vibrant color!
Your eyeliner is amazing! I can never get mine to be that even and sharp. Know that even though it’s tough right now, things will get better. My mantra is a quote I heard a while back: “everything will be okay in the end. If it’s not okay, it’s not the end” :)
Hello! Just stopping in to say hello and let you know you're absolutely gorgeous! Also, LOVE that shirt!
Hey, after reading through your post history, I realize how incredibly strong, resilient, and caring you are. I hope you are doing better soon, I’m sending so much love and positive vibes your way because you really really deserve it. I hope you’re able to take some time for yourself and do things you like to do and eat foods you like to eat and rest if you need it. Stay strong! Hope you have a fantastic week!
Life can be really tough at times. But i find at times like this its best to pull out and look at the big picture. These things come in waves and they’ll go back out eventually. Things will get better.
Your very pretty, I hope you can take your black toast and turn it in to a toast of gold.
Hell dude, 90 hours a week? Holy shit. I hope you’ve been getting a lot of rest and staying hydrated. Sucks about your mom but I’m no stranger to parental drug use. It’ll get better hopefully. You’re also a handsome guy man. I also have a kitten and I love the hell out of my little man. Cats are great! What do you do for your job? Give it a smile next picture 🙃
Well to point out the obvious and least important things , you’re super handsome and you have amazing skin!!! 

Have you already seen what your new kitten looks like? What colour is it ? He or she will definitely keep your spirits up! :) do you have any other pets ? 

I’m sorry about your mom. It’s upsetting that you think you’re not going anywhere in life . You work 90hours a week, that’s more hours than any man I’ve ever known. Don’t be so hard on yourself you should be really proud of yourself . Working that hard while also dealing with family drama is a lot ! 

Hope you’re taking care of yourself on your down time away from work and your moms troubles. Doing things you enjoy doing. Extremely important if you want to keep your sanity lol 💕
Well, that sucks. It really does. I would love to be all "yeah, but 90 hours is better than 100, innit? " and it sucks. 

But what doesn't suck is the outcome. You may not see it as such, but it shows your character. It shows a guy that would go far for what he believes. A dedicated and good man. 

Your eyes tell me you are one to listen to, because you got some brains. Good looking out mate
You have kind eyes! Hang in there!
First off, I’m so fucking sorry you gotta work 90 hours a week. No one deserves that and I’m sorry the system sucks :(

But, on a more positive note, your hair is nice af and you have nice, even, blemish free skin :)
90 hours a week?!  Dude, you're a *monster*... I wish I had half of your drive and energy to be able to pull that off.  With that kind of work ethic, I'm sure things will play into something better for you if you just keep playing your cards right.  Strength like that is *rare*.
You have really lovely and kind eyes.
I literally can't imagine how tired you must feel on a daily basis. I ache just imagining it. It's gotta be rough, but you're handsome, and you're very strong willed to have broken your addiction. I don't think you can keep this workload up forever, so it's smart that you've got this financial advisor to help you. Maybe you can set up a comfortable nest egg for later.
What is it you want to do? You sound like someone who is not happy where they are at, so if it is tech-related, let me know. Maybe I can help.
The first two sentences of this title make you a better man than 99% of the population. I feel like a beta complaining about the little problems I have. I truly hope things get better for you brother, because you sure as hell deserve it.
Coming from a woman, you have very kind eyes and a welcoming smile! You give off nonthreatening vibes in a good way, like somebody who would give great hugs! Also, you clearly have an amazing work ethic to be able to make working 90+ hour weeks doable. I had a difficult time making 60 work! You’re honestly doing really great as far as that goes, and your diligence will not go unnoticed! Keep your chin up, good things are coming for you.
Edit: I realize now that you aren’t even physically smiling, your eyes are just very expressive of your clear inherent goodness! Props.
For starters, that handsome ass face aint half bad to have on a rainy day. Second, who knows where we're going in life? You only ever know where you wanna be when you really get there yanno? Do what you gotta do, keep chasing those passions, kiss a girl, kiss a guy, do what you gotta do friend. If you have to work your life away for now, make it up later when you have the time. I know this is hippy dippy "just think positive" bullshit but aye man, i'm just hopin for the best for ya!
You're very handsome! I mean, look at that cool ass hair, kind and beautiful eyes, ideal lips and great skin. Also, as a fellow opiate addict in recovery (1 year sober), don't ever forget how far you've come and how much better of a person you are now. Give yourself credit for that, and hold your head high. Since getting clean, I've had to find new ways to make myself happy. Remember, practice self-care. Find something you enjoy that you can get into, even if it's only for 1 hour per day. YouTube videos are a mini release for me. Whether you want something funny, interesting, motivational, creepy or educational... it's all there. Music has practically saved my life. Oh, and I'm incredibly jealous of your new fur baby. =)
just want to say that a kitten is a lot of work and you definitely need to be around more than 10 or 20 hours a week. besides that hope things work out for you
Kittens are awesome. Also. Your hair is pretty awesome too.
You are adopting a kitten!!! That's more happiness than you had before! It's the little things in life that count!
It takes serious commitment to work 90+ hours a week, and you have that! You’re a really hardworking man, and that’s something i can’t say for myself, so you should take pride in that. I’m sure you’ll be a great cat dad too!
Wow, you have clearly been through a lot, but you are still standing strong. And also, damn your skin is glowing. I have a thorough skin care routine yet you have way better skin than me. What's your secret?

I find it very positive that you are getting a kitten. I bet you'll be an awesome cat dad and a great companion.
Hey dude, sorry to hear about your mom. I hope she gets the help she needs and gets better soon. I’m so happy to hear you’ll be getting a kitten! They’re such good pals and it’ll love you so so much! It’s amazing how good it feels when you get home and crash and your cat friend is there to curl up with you and chill. Also, Navi is such a good name! Is it a Zelda reference? If so... good taste :P if you ever need someone to talk to I’m always free to lend an ear and make a friend! I hope this week treats ya well! :3
Working like that is tough man. Stay strong, and take care of that kitten!
I see that you’re here putting yourself out there in this group and you fucking WANT things to get better. Honestly dude, I can tell you’re going to be okay.
Yeah, oil is worse than the military.. lol stayin hydrated for sure! I get 5-6 of sleep on a good night though. I can't help getting off of work and sitting if front of the TV for an hour or two after work. Feels like the only thing that breaks my days apart other than sleep. For my mom, I know I dont hate her, I hate her addiction but it's really hard to separate those two sometimes... and for the kitty, I'm stoked, she's a little lynx kitten and I think I'll name her Navi. I just hope me working so many hours doesn't affect her too much. She'll have a big sister to take care of her though. thank you for the compliment btw (:
No one's ever commented on my skin (: 

She's a siamese lynx so she's all white with grey stripes on her tail legs and face with bright blue eyes 😻 I've only seen pictures of her on the internet but I can just tell she'll fit right into the family (my gf and other cat) I'm seriously so excited to get her.

It's ok, I just remember growning up having so much fun with my mom. I was about 13 when she started letting herself go though, so I'm pretty used to it now. I'm just frustrated I cant be there to help and my little sister has to deal with all of it.

I definitely get off of work and do some fun things, which has it's down sides though. I dont get much sleep anymore... lol

Anyways, thank you for all of your kind words!
Thank you. I don't hear that much.
It's like upper management likes to put us through hell. They say yes to the impossible and we accomplish it just to make them look good with no reward other that the government taxing the hell out of our overtime. It's a fucked system is what it is. Stay in school kids, no one deserves this. 

Thank you, I've been slicking it back for only a couple months now because it was tickling my face and driving me nuts and I'm never cutting it short again after the military lol and for my skin, my secret is only wash with water. Soap dries my skin up and cause breakouts.
Thank you! Tbh, I dont wash my face with any product. I just make sure my hands are super clean and gently scrub with my hands in the shower (: it does take a little while for your natural oils to balance out, so expect a couple break outs until then.  

I'm super stoked about the kitten, she'll be a great addition to the family (another cat)
She was 6 months sober this last time before she went back to drinking. The whole family was coming together again and pretty much fell apart in one day. My dad enables all of it and holds it against her. But this has been going on for 20 years so I'm pretty much fed up with it. I just hope she gets better soon, there's so much life happening right now.. And yes!! Navi from Zelda (: you're the only one who gotten that! Lol I'll absolutely take you up on that offer, you have definitely made my day a little better, thank you (:
Hey man must be good money for ya to be crushing them hours out. 90 a week how many hours a Day is that? Of course man. And that’s a cute ass name. And I know man. Your mom and her addiction tie hand in hand and it sucks sometimes. Especially seeing our family struggle like that.. life is hard and all we ever wanna do is drown it out :/
I guess that is why you are here. I meant every word. You look good man  nohomo😉
Lmao! My husband does the exact same thing for his skin! He has lighter skin that’s more sensitive like yours. It blew my mind when he told me that. 

I have olive skin that’s more oily, so I have to use oil reducing acne wash. But now that I’m an adult I’m blemish free too thank god.

And yeah I feel you on the work thing. That’s why r/antiwork is a good place to vent lol.
I’m so sorry to hear that... it’s so so hard to watch someone you care about struggle. ): I hope that down the road she can be clean and realize what a great supportive son she has. Also, I’m so surprised no one caught on to the Zelda thing! Maybe I just have video games on the brain haha. I’m glad I was able to brighten your day! 😊
You would think I was saving a bunch of money! Lol I mean I'm not struggling to make ends meet but I'm not good with saving the rest. I honestly don't know where it all goes! I recently got a financial advisor though, so maybe we can iron out some of that. I'm working 14 hours a day give or take depending on the day, 12 on 2 off. And I get what she's going through, truly. I was an opiate addict and have been clean for two years. I just know what it does to people on the outside and never want to put anyone else through that again. I feel like my mom just doesn't care about what it does to us.
Lol r/antiwork is amazing, thank you for showing me that. Makes me feel a little less alone (:
I don’t know the whole situation but once you’re that far down the rabbit hole you just never notice the affects or if you do you’re too high too care. I’m glad you’re clean man! Best thing for ya. Couldn’t be working those long weeks still high.
Darling you matter and you are worthy. You matter a lot. Reach out for professional help, you can get better but you need to ask for help.
You are enough. You were born enough. You will always matter, you matter to me now enough to be typing this when I should be sleeping. Life can be amazing, give it a shot.


Sending a super big healing hug 🤗
i’m sorry that you’re going through that. as someone who’s been through (and is still going through) those struggles, i know it’s hard to stay positive and push through. you are good enough. you just being alive is good enough! if you ever need to talk to another teen about anything, i’m always available to message on reddit. i know this stuff is hard to go through alone, but you’ve got this!
First of all, you look really cute. Secondly, there is no such thing as good enough. You’re here, you’re who you are, it doesn’t matter if you’re good enough, cause you’re doing your best and that’s gonna have to be good enough.
It’s awful that you’re going through this at 15. I really hope you have good people in your life to support you. You honestly look perfectly fine, and you should be happy with yourself! If others can’t see that, they aren’t worth your time.
hugs are the best thank you!
thank you it means a lot
Dude; you look unquestionably male to me. College is hard, especially when you have to deal with depression and dysphoria, but just hang in there and it’ll get better. HRT truly does help so much.

I’m sure you’ll have no trouble passing in either sense of the word. Good luck!
Look like a guy to me. Didn't think girl when I saw your pic at all. Had to read what you wrote to know.
You are enough. 


I’m gay. We are in the same community. That’s something I wish I’d heard, and I want you to know that. Your value is not defined by how others perceive you, or your gender. You are awesome just as you are and as the genuine version of you, a more beautiful life with grow AROUND you with time. Do not conform to the life you have. Give it time.
What are you taking in school?
Never would I have guessed that you were not male. You got this! Good luck to you
I'm transgender myself, and so I know how you feel. I'm not out yet, and I'm not on hormones either, but I have been dabbling with different ways to feel more feminine, including even wearing nail polish. When I do, I feel better about myself, but I also feel naked.. like people can see right through me. It's rough, but I just need to get outside of my own head. You can definitely pass for male, you've got a sort of Michael Shanks (from SG-1) vibe.  


EDIT: I forgot to say, please please please don't try to do that to yourself again. Suicide claims far too many of us, and it always breaks my heart and makes me cry to hear of more. We need beautiful souls like you in this world.
Wow. You really look like a guy. I wouldn’t believe you if you said u were a female.
dude before i read the caption i thought you were a guy. u look great!
Hey, I know most people have said this but man, you really pass! :) I’m sure T will help you even more down the road (emotionally and physically!) I also want to say CONGRATS at almost being through school! That’s a MAJOR accomplishment! So proud of you and rooting for you! If you ever need a friend to talk with or vent to I’m always open for a conversation! Otherwise keep a smile on your face cuz YOUVE GOT THIS!
I looked at the picture before I read the title, and I definitely saw a man.
You pass!! And even if you didn't, there is no rule that dictates how a person should look to fit into a gender. You are enough, good enough, and strong enough whether you are on T or not. You can make it through! 

And you will always have a home in the LGBT+ Community.
Im gonna be honest, i saw the pic before reading it and you pass fricking well 👌please don't do anything you'll regret theres so many people who care about you and im sure would be happy to talk, here 4 you if you need someone to talk to :D
You pass far better than you realize! Coming out is a huge step, and you should be super proud of yourself- it takes a lot of bravery to do something like that. You are strong and smart and you can crush this coming semester!
You're a gorgeous young man!
One of my best friends just came out as trans and holy shit seeing her out was like seeing her soul for the first time. She’s become this confident, outgoing person and I don’t think she even realizes that anything has seemed to have changed. You’re going to pass, and that’s because it’s just who you are. Under all the exterior bullshit it’s just fucking true. And as I learned recently, its pretty damn easy to see when a person is living in who they are. Keep going. You’re a badass for coming this far.
I'm a Writing major!
Thank you! I've done everything short of hormones/surgery, but the self hating part of me worries regardless.
Thank you!
What that's awesome! Congrats! You're doing like a huge transition in your life in more ways than one. I don't know how either of these things feel but I imagine it's a tad scary and stressful. I think you are super cute and I hope it all goes as well as possible.
It's far too easy for us to find reasons to hate ourselves, you need to look for things you love about yourself. You're an amazing man, and you're so brave to be taking this road! I know just how hard it is, and I also know from experience that most trans people I've met had the brightest, loveliest hearts. Look at that smile, you have an inner warmth and kindness that shines through!
Thank you!!
Aw you're gonna make me cry! That's really sweet of you. 

By the way, if you need someone to talk to, my DMs are open. I snooped through your post history (genuine curiosity, not anything malicious!) and saw you're having a rough time. Maybe we could lean on each other? Just a thought.
Thank you. Yeah, my life is pretty rough right now, but I try to keep a positive outlook and not worry about my issues, which leads to less stress at least. I'm open to DM's though, yeah. I just found this reddit last night but it's felt so good connecting with people like this, and trying to help brighten their days.
It's wonderful to help other people, agreed!
Hang in there :) you have pretty eye color and nice full lips! Also nice wavy hair.

Moving isn’t all bad. Sometimes it’s the door to something better, you just don’t know it yet. I always dreaded moving, but I wouldn’t be where I am right now without any of those moves. It finally paid off!
Woah. I am sending you a spiritual "Hang In There, Baby!" motivational cat poster. Also you have good hair
your hair is amazing, what shampoo do you use? I'm not saying this just because you asked to be toasted, I am genuinely wondering. your hair is actually so t h i c c c c c c c and shiny.

&#x200B;

and you have a really nice face. idk I know this is all purely shallow but I don't know you that well. you seem like a nice person though. hang in there! you can get through this. I'm here for you anytime if you need to talk. 💚  💚  💚
have a lovey birthday.
I am sorry you are going through difficult times.
I wish you the best.
ur adorable
Hey! Happy birthday! I’m sending happy positive waves your way! I hope your move goes well, and this time next year you’re healthy, and on hormones, and happy. :) have a wonderful day friend!
Oh, you poor thing. I hope this issue doesn't permanently prevent you from receiving HRT. You are incredibly brave to share your problems here with everyone, and I know if you start HRT someday, you'll be even more amazing! Shine on like a diamond. :)
Happy birthday and I wish you the best of luck beating your medical condition, moving etc
Damn dude you look ready to take on the world! And btw I looked at your profile and I couldn’t tell you were ftm
And you still look so good after all that? Goddamn fam
I use Pantene. But I think I was just blessed by Dionysus 🙏🏻

Thanks ❤️
It shouldn’t permanently prevent me from HRT, it just felt like another blow on top of everything. Thank you kind stranger! :)
I'm trans myself, so I really feel for you. I hope you have an amazing day and good luck! EDIT: Oh yeah, happy birthday too!
Filters can't hide real beauty. You'd be beautiful without them.
I know it hurts to find out the people you thought were friends were fake.
I don't know the details, but please don't blame yourself for it. You look like a nice person to talk to, so I'm sure you have no problem getting along with the people you like - and if people are being fake, fuck'em.

You're gorgeous and you would definitely be even without filters!
Hang in there. Keep looking and you’ll find good friends. You make a good friend, by the way
Here's 2 things you don't need: filters and those fake friends. Don't the fake ones make you feel bad about yourself, and maybe cut a few ties with them. And filters are ok, but you shouldn't rely on them, especially when you're so amazing!
I get ghosted incessantly. I can tell you this, it doesn't make you a bad person. It makes you someone with a big heart who doesn't take friendships lightly. The good people of this sub would never ghost you.
You are beautiful and you can see that beyond the filters
dude... we're in the same boat. you honestly seem like a really nice person. I would totally want to be your friend. and you are too good for those fakers. they clearly don;t realize how good of a person you are, and if they go on being like this you might as well just ditch them for better friends. and I'm sure you're just as beautiful without the filters. your eyebrow game is very strong my dude. 

&#x200B;

anyways. I'm here for you anytime if you need to talk. hope you have a wonderful day/night.  💚  💚  💚
Your eyes are really pretty! Ever heard of r/eyes maybe you could start small and take a picture of just your eyes without a filter. ✌️❤️
hey, i'm sorry about the shitty action of the "friends". as someone who's also struggled with finding loyalty and their people, just keep in mind the idea that it's better to be alone than in bad company. it's not always EASY or comfortable to be alone, but it's a nice chance to get more okay with it, to know yourself better, and become a better friend to you. keep that in the back of your head and also remember that one day, you'll have your people.
Why would anyone ghost you? You are beautiful and I’m sure fun to be around. Ultimately gorgeous it’s their loss not yours.🌹
Selfies are over-rated. Fock em
You are very beautiful, you doesn't need a filter 
And about the friend people come and leave you stil have a family and one hope you will find someone who are not fake
Ghosting is awful. I've been guilty of it myself, and it is not something I'm proud of. It's convenient, but WRONG. I'm sorry that you've been dealing with it. You have piercing eyes, and they are fantastic
Your jawline is perfect and your hair is cool af
You look like Jesus with different hair color but better
Your eyes are gorgeous! Just know that gaining weight doesn’t diminish the kind of person you are, you are still beutiful regardless of what you weight! Own your body, its yours and its beutiful. Plus, just know that theres people out there that love you and mental health issues are a scary and dificult thing that you are a survivor of for living with them. I hope the best for you,
Hey there. Your big brown eyes are beautiful. And I really like your glasses. My advice would be to think about your surroundings (work/home/people/friends) and ask yourself if you were to leave it and find something different/new would you be ok? And TELL yourself YES you would be. Change is good and can heal you in ways you never thought possible. Much love!
Hey, just wanted to say you have really smooth skin and gorgeous eyes! Just keep in mind that weight fluctuates and it's perfectly normal to have ups and downs. The same goes for mental health. It's only a matter of time before things get better!
Like you, I've suffered from a mysterious medical condition that was misdiagnosed for several years.  Be persistent, don't give up on your quest for the truth.  If you don't get answers from one doctor, seek the opinion of a second, or a third, or a fourth, or however many it takes for you to get the proper diagnosis.  You're worth it, and your heart is full of love, even if you have a heart condition.
If your a girl you are cute
I love ur glasses!! Very Cute : ) I am highkey attached to the people who work at my local taco bell too, so ur hats makin me smile too. Stay strong, mental health is one of those things that can totally fluctuate. Give it time and take care of yourself when you can. u are definitely worth it.
You’re adorable.
After a quick look at your profile, I definitely want to hang out with you sometime. Trust me, you’re gonna be fine
Nice hair cut dude.
Edit *not as serious as
You look like a really mature, dependable 16 year old and self deprecating people are the best - always really dry and funny! Also, you're going to be one of those men who grows into their looks and ends up as a heartbreaker at 25...
ur nose is so cute!
Thanks
In all honesty I read it as hair cat for a second 😂
Sorry I don't understand what do you mean by heartbreaker in this context
Thanks
I think you're going to end up really handsome! Haha sorry for my UK English
Oh sorry I didn't understand before thanks tho😄
I could just stare at your eyes like a totally insane person, OR THE SANEST PERSON EVER, for hours. Your lips are like harrowed poetry, filled with love and hurt.
Not sure why people going in and negatively voting comments here. I appreciate all of them.
You don't need negativity like that. You're awesome and she clearly doesn't realize that. I'm sure she ripped out a piece of your heart when she packed up her stuff, but you're resilient. You're a survivor. And if it's one thing you definitely are it's that you're better off without her. Time will heal wounds but you deserve to be in company of people who do know you're worth a damn. And not just any damn. I'd say a "hot damn". You're worth so much more than someone could ever say because only you know your own selfworth because it is you alone who defines your selfworth. I'm sorry it's going to be tough for awhile but here's to you! Here's to a change of higher standards! Here's to you showing the rest of the world what you've known your whole life: you are beyond awesome! And here's to all the other people you will find along the way that know that as well! Cheers!
You have the jawline I want and you have the eyes of a fantasy character.
You are beautiful, and you have a lot to contribute to the world and others. She's obviously missing out, but that's her mistake to make. Don't think of it as losing something, because if she's not able to appreciate having someone amazing like you in her life, she's only wasting your time in the long run. I know that it hurts, but try to do things for yourself that will make you happy, you deserve to pamper yourself. Have an amazing day!
I'm really sorry about your ex. she doesn't deserve someone as good as you. there's probably a better girl out there for you. you might feel heartbroken right now, but you are strong! you can get through this. I'm here for you anytime if you need to talk.  💚  💚  💚 

&#x200B;

side note: you are like. the most beautiful person I have ever seen. your eyes are such a beautiful color and your nose ring looks amazing on your.
So sorry about your ex... breakups suck... I know you are strong enough to get through it to the other side though :) it’s so hard to see it as new open door now, but sometimes the change that hurts the most is the change that’s needed. I know you’ll be doing great in a few weeks and will find someone who loves, respects and cherishes you as much as you cherish, respect and love them. I hope you have a wonderful week! Keep your chin up :)
You deserve better than someone who can (and did) just walk away without an explanation!! And you will find them!! 

&#x200B;

On a side note, you are gorgeous!
That was a shitty thing for her to do. Maybe just maybe you’re better off without her. You certainly deserve to be treated better.
You'll feel shitty now, and for a while, but I know you're strong enough to come out of this as a complete and resilient woman. Also, your eyes are the exact shade of blue that the sky is! Be strong, let yourself grieve for three years of your life  and PM me if you want to vent to a stranger 😺
When people want to walk away let them walk. She doesn't control your destiny. It's not that she's a bad person, it just means that her part of your story is over. You're a gorgeous woman who can have someone in your life who won't abandon you. Don't go chasing. Stay strong. You're in my thoughts.
You’re a gorgeous lady, there are so many women out there who you could make so happy. The end of anything is tough, especially when it’s unexpected, but life will continue on and better experiences will come out of it. Stay strong, I believe in you.
Honestly this made me cry. Thank you, I haven’t been complimented like this in years
T-t-t- toasted. Thank you. I just got out of therapy and seeing these comments is definitely what I needed. I am strong. I will get through this bullshit
Wow thank you so much. I appreciate that
Thank you, I know it’s far down the line but one day I’ll see that this happened for a reason. It’s becoming clear right now
She definitely has quite a bit of mental illness whatever that may be going on. I hope she gets help before it’s too late. That’s all I can hope for. I’ll be fine, just working on loving myself
You can hope, and help if she asks for it. And good for you, take care of yourself.
You look like a druid from dungeons and dragons. I hope that is a compliment for ya. I like fantasy.
You’re my type!! 😍
You also like Battlestar Galactic? Dude, just when I thought you couldn’t rock any harder, you go and rock even harder.

Thanks for being a ray of sunshine in this world.

Cheers.
Seeing you makes me happy 😊
You look like a genuine dude. Bonus points for the Metallica sign in the back.
Haha thanks 😊
Nice to know 😆
Thank you, I love BSG 😊
Aww thank you, that's sweet 😊
you look just fine! don’t let them get  you down <3 whoever colored your hair did a damn fine job, looks shiny and healthy :)
I’m sorry. Life is hard enough WITH parents support. Hang in there friend. It will get better, I promise.
They must be blind!! You’re really handsome!
You look great your choice of glasses are confusing me XD but in a good way i would find you interesting and would certainly have a talk if you aproached me. Have a great Day!
I’m sure that what your parents said/think hurts. But keep your head up. You are who you are, and you are wonderful. You touch the lives of those around you, even if you don’t realize it. Keep doing you and try to ignore the toxicity of those who are too small minded to accept you.
You look totally cute and your parents sound like real assholes. It sucks, but chosen family tends to be the reality for most folks in  our LGBT+ community. It's always getting better, but until it's completely safe, you have us!
Your parents are wrong first of all. You don't at all look like a he she. Just remember that not everyone in this world is bigoted and we can't choose our family but we CAN choose who we let into our lives. Go to a pride parade and I promise you will feel accepted. We are here for you <3
I wish I had your facial structure. Very handsome!
You are none of those things. I don’t understand how difficult it can be living as a trans person as I am cis, but I do know what it’s like being LGBT+, and I understand the struggle of not being accepted. You aren’t alone during these difficult times, if you ever need to talk pop by any trans subreddit, or the lgbt subreddit. We’re here for you. You’re very good looking by the way, I hope you’re doing okay dear.
My God the amount of bravery it takes to put up with that shit. Here's to that alone!

You're adorable. If you were sitting alone at a bar, I'd immediately try to buy you a drink assuming I don't trip in the process of walking over to you. Hopefully you'd talk to me and girlfriend. 99% sure you'd make an awesome friend. It's a good thing your parents don't have any taste in trans men because I wouldn't want them at the bar anyway. I'm sure they're black holes in more than just intellect and the ways of sex appeal. Also, you're cute. They're dense. And, now, I kind of wish I went to bars in the first place. Cheers! To someone who actually does know bull shit when he hears it!
Okay first, your face is not fat, your face shape is lovely, you've got a nice mouth that probably holds a wicked smile, and I dig the buddy holly glasses.  It hurts, and it should, that tpeople who should support you are cruel, but it is their failing not yours, and you choose your own destiny.
You look great, and I would be happy to have you as my kid.
There are few people in this world who truly pull off thick rimmed glasses without them looking like a tacky accessory - you are one of these people. They look true and so do you. You look true. That is a lot.
You look fly af, so no need to give a damn what your parents say!
Well I'm trans too and I think you look handsome! Don't listen to your parents, you look amazing.
You look fantastic. I love your hair color and your glasses look really nice on you.
I don’t know what your parents are talking about!  I’m a mom, so I will tell you what I would tell my children:  you have been a delight since the day you were born.  You are incredibly brave, and I’m proud to know you.  And you are perfectly lovely, however you identify yourself.  You are enough.  Let me know how I can help.
You look fantastic! You deserve to be the "you" you are most comfortable with! Keep at and time to find some support friends!
You look like quite a handsome fella.

I’m so sorry your parents are denying your validity. As for me, I believe I you, I know with certainty that you’re valid, and I love you unconditionally.

Sending love, comfort, encouragement, and hope.

Peace.
I'm so sorry for what you're going through.  I wish I could hug you.  You are a beautiful person.  You have value.  There is nothing wrong with you, and you are not disgusting, or fat faced.  Sometimes the family you make is more supportive and helpful than the one you're born with.   If you need someone to talk to, please DM me.  I'm always happy to have a new friends.  Life will get better, as you gain more independence.  Please reach out to local LGBTQ groups.  They will help you.
Wow, your parents are crazy. That's definitely not what you look like. You look like a cool dude with good taste in glasses.
You rock those frames, and you look super cool and fun to be around
I'm so sorry to hear about your parents!  Also, you are definitely not a disgusting fat-faced he-she, you look amazing and you're really really handsome ngl. you pass very very *very* well. don't listen to them. they're just being stupid. I'm here for you anytime if you need to talk, I hope you have an amazing day/night.  💚  💚  💚
Heck, I didn't even think you were trans until I saw your intro. I wish I passed as well as you, man.
You don't look bad. You look great. Fuck your parents.
I’m so sorry your parents aren’t supportive of you. You’re a beautiful person and I hope you find beautiful people in your life that will love and support you for who you are 💖
Hey friend! Sorry your parents kinda suck... just know that I support you! You’re valid! You’re strong! I know you’ve got this! If you ever need a friend please let me know! I’m always open to talk to if needed! You’re not disgusting or fat faced. You’re a handsome strong guy who’s fucking got this! Have a great week and keep your chin up :)
I have a trans son and am consistently amazed not just by him, but by the community as a whole. The raw fucking GUTS you show is absolutely inspirational. You are living an authentic life and being true to yourself, and that takes more balls than most people have that were born with them. I know I dont know you, but wish I did. I'm so fucking proud of you, and have no doubt you are an amazing young man, and I would so proud to have you as a son.

I am incredibly  sorry your parents cannot accept you for who are, and see the strong, fierce, amazing son they have. I know nothing could replace having parents that support you, but they sound like GIANT assholes, so ignore them and know there IS support out there for you, tons of it right here on reddit. 

If you ever need ANYTHING, please message me, even if you just need someone to talk to. ESPECIALLY  if you just need to to talk. 

Take card of yourself, and remember to hit me up, that offer is 100%.
Your parents are idiots and you are very handsome. Great eyebrows.
You remind me of my little brother! 

Your family sounds like they need to get over themselves and get their shit together. It's not about you, it's about them. You keep doing you, and make yourself happy as can be. It will get better. 

And remember, you will always have a family within the LGBT+ Community. <3

Good luck!
Okay, I just need to say that, first of all, the first things that I look at when I see the image of a person are their eyes, so my immediate thought was "wtf is Chris Evans doing on r/toastme?"

Don't let them get to you. <3

I imagine that they're having a hard time forgeting their daughter. Maybe it will just take some time for them to realize that you were and still are their son. I just can't rationalize how they could think any of those things about you when you are so handsome.
I didn’t know what was real until I got away from my parents. Turned out I was more right than I thought. You’re young, hot, and really brave. FUCK your parents. It makes me deeply angry that they’d choose any backwards belief over their goddamn child. Good for you for getting this far. You’re not alone. <3
You might have a baby face, but that only means that you’re going to age really well! You are super handsome and you look like a really nice person. Your parents might not be very supportive of you, but you can find lots of love and support from friends and found family.
Your parents are wrong. You look good. You have every right to be here and live your life. And no matter what you do, you are stronger than them.
You’re awesome as you are!  Be done with anyone who belittles you, no matter how difficult.  You deserve better!
Don’t listen to ur parents dude, u to pass real fuckin well. I love the color of ur hair in comparison to ur darker colored eyebrows too, it looks super cool. Pls remember that u can always choose who ur real family is : ) ur def a 10/10
Don't give them a chance by not engaging in those types of conversations with them. You look good and you have every right to be who you are. You'll settle into your yourself and realise what lies they were saying. You've had the courage to step up this far, you know you'll make it with or without their support.
You’re certainly handsome, and *definitely not* fat-faced! 

I’m sorry your parents are acting like that. We can be your online fam if you want. Have you eaten today? Taken your meds? Getting enough sleep?
As a twenty something trans guy, I am insanely jealous of how manly you look
You look like a beautiful, skinny-faced, he-she
I saw your profile pic and was kind of hoping you were a cute girl with a tom-boy haircut (or androgynous at the very least) -- so I'd say your folks are wrong.

10/10, would ask out on a date (and would love to see in a sundress)
Thank you! Been working on going no contact, and this might have been the final push.
In the moment, it’s hard to remember that, so thank you
Maybe they should borrow my glasses...? No, but, thank you
Much appreciated! My glasses are pretty much my favorite accessory
That’s the hopeful plan— to cut out those who would cut me down and all that. Thank you
Thank you! It’s true. That whole shared experience of risking safety for authenticity thing haha. There’s probably joke in there about fire forged friendships and flaming homosexuals but...
Always wanted to go to Pride, so the next one might just be my year. Thank you
Even though I posted on this sub I still got all flustered at the compliment. Thank you so much!
Thank you. Even if you don’t understand the exact same pressures faced, we’re both stigmatized and I appreciate the support
I didn’t realize I needed to hear that until I read it. Thank you, really and truly. It means a great deal to me, especially coming from a mother
We’re our own worst critics, mate, and thanks!
Haha thank you for your kind words! 

As for forgetting “her”... she’s been dead nearly 8 years, and for 4 years I’ve lived as male so. They’re gonna have to get used to it and I’m not going to keep my life on hold any longer.
I get to be the baby faced dude laughing at the old farts then? Good to know! 

Thank you for the kind words
Working on it every day, and these comments all helped!
Working on cutting ties, because you’re right :)
It’s the small things, like you saying I pass. Thank you!
I plan on cutting them out as soon as possible so they can’t drag me down further. Thank you
Thanks mate! That means a lot

Now go sleep!
19 is a tough age. All the shit you're going through now is just a learning curve - take all the knowledge you can from it and trust that things will get better. You'll be fine x

PS: I love your hair!
You have beautiful features! Giant eyes and full lips? Very pretty. Also, at 19 i struggled as well. All the way til u was about 22. And life got so much better. Pick up a hobby just for the joy of it to infuse your life with a little happiness.
You're perfect. 
Stop trying to figure out who you are supposed to be and decide who you want to be.  Write down your moral values.  Your goals.  What makes you happy
And if it's not on that list. Fuck it.
You are very very pretty and those eyes 😍😍😍
People pay cash money for cheekbones like that, and your skin could be the ‘after’ in a proactiv commercial. You actually make multicolored hair look cute also!
Aw baby, you look so cute. Trust me, you'll be fine eventually. Life sucks when you're 19.
I'm so overwhelmed by these comments. Thank you all so much, I really do feel much better. I don't know what else I can say other than I'm so happy that there are so many positive people who care about making others happy. I hope everyone who upvoted or commented has a great day, just know that you've made someone else's!!
Don't hate how you look, your hair is great! And you have a sweet face. 

I'm not sure if anybody really knows where they're going, especially at 19. If they say they do they're either lying, crazy or very very driven by some desire. Most of us just see what happens, make decisions as they come to us and basically just wing it. I'm still winging it 20+ years on, but I do remember it was something that worried me a lot in my mid teens and it used to keep me awake at night. Things worked out though, and I'm sure they will for you.
When I was 19, I was in an abusive relationship. I was always self conscious about my weight. I worked a dead end job at McDonald's, and I failed out of college for my dream job (software engineering). Now I'm 23, single and taking the time to find myself, getting in shape, and making more money as a CNC machinist than I ever thought I would.

Life changes in the blink of an eye. It's okay if you don't know who you are or what you want to do. You are still young. As am I. We have time to figure things out. Who we are now is likely not who we will be a few years from now. Keep your chin up and look forward, even if the path is hazy and unclear. You've got this.
Damn girl you are beautiful! Your eyes are just gorgeous! Please don’t feel sad, if you want to talk about what’s bothering you, please dm me.
you’re cute as actual fuck though- clear skin, lovely kind eyes, full lips and biiiiitch i’m so jealous of your hair. 
Teenage years are shit, but sometimes u just gotta get real stoned, look in a mirror and see that you don’t look anything like the adolescent self about which you grew to be so insecure. You’re blooming, flourishing. It’s ok not to have a plan, either - just a bit of faith in the universe that you’ll end up somewhere you’re happy. you got this!! 💙💖
19 is a rough transitional age, I promise things will turn up soon! You have the most magical unicorn hair and lips people pay tons of money for!
You have beautiful, kind eyes! I’m gonna let you in on a little secret... hardly anyone knows where they’re going at age 19. You have plenty of time to explore options!
At the risk of sounding like a serial killer: you have beautiful skin
If it makes you feel better, I had no idea what I was doing when I was 19 either. I think it’s a common feeling. But it worked itself out, and I have a feeling it will for you too :)

P.s you have gorgeous lips! The kind people wish they could pay a lot of money for. You’d be a great lipstick model. I can tell you have an amazing sense of individual style and I admire you for that.
You are gorgeous. Your hair is magical and your eyes are really lovely!
As for where you're going in life, you're gonna figure it out. It'll just take a little time.
Don't let negative thoughts ruin your self esteem. You are a beautiful person and I hope one day you can see that.
Love your hair and your eyes
You are beautiful! Sweet eyes and a mouth women would kill for. You are young - just go one step at a time, one day at a time, etc. Plans will fall into place and you will find a more clear path as you get older. Just avoid toxic people, skeezy salesman, and too much self-doubt. When I feel like its all crap and I can't do it anymore, I am usually just tired and need a nap. Yes, like toddler, and I am nearing 40.
You really slayed it with your hair! Normally I wouldn't think that those colors would go together well, but you make it look so good! Keep your chin up, because for whatever reason you are down there's a way that it will go back up. Just keep smiling and touching people's lives!
As someone who is also trying to figure their life out, I feel you. I wish the best of luck on finding peace and happiness, sis :)
The world is massive. This is the first thing to know. On average a human speaks 870 million words in their lifetime. There are roughly 7.8 Billion people on this planet. Thinking about this in my life has been a freeing experience. It’s allowed me to not be so attached to the ideals and standards of the environment I was raised by. This planet is so much bigger than we can even really comprehend. If you dedicated one word to every human you could in your life, you wouldn’t be able to hit 1/7 of the current population. That’s not even considering new people that will be created in your lifetime.

What this means to me is, whoever you are, wherever you are, you are exactly you. No better or worse. But always changing. Our bodies on average replace every cell over the course of about 7 years (from what I’ve heard). You are becoming something more every day. That is the human experience, we are in a constant bloom. We never really are anything, we are becoming anything we want. 

So to you I would say this. 

You are a beautiful blossom that is just beginning to become something else. I don’t know what it is and that means there is limitless potential in you, you can control the direction you go to a certain degree if you are aware. Keep in mind however that the forces of your environment will always play a role in how you change too. To that end, the world is so large that I’m sure there are people out there who are going to be your family and community if you look for them. Keep moving and experience this vastness with an open heart and kindness. You will find great places. You are not confined to the world you see. Good luck:)
You look like a dolly version of Billie Eillish
Your a Cute huggable person
It's okay! It's okay to not know who you are or where you're going. It's okay to cry, to scream. That means you're *alive.* I promise you, you're not alone. When you start to put the pieces of you together, when you start feeling better, you'll know it was all worth it.

Sometimes we fall apart to shape into a different portrait. You got this. Keep pushing, you're beautiful and most of all, you're *worth it.*
You look amazing! Don't let shit get you down.
you look great, don't sell yourself short.

Anyone who collects CD's like you do is a friend of mine! I'd like to hear what some of your favorite bands are.
You probably wont have a sense of self until 30, so quit trying and enjoy the ride. All of your experiences over the next few years will determine who you are ! Best of Luck!
You have such kind eyes and I love your hair girl! Keep that chin up, things will get better for you <3
Very few people at 19 know where they’re going.  
You’re young, you’re cute, smile and live your life at your best.  
Things will eventually all come at their place.  
Cheers.
You're nice.
You are so naturally beautiful that it makes you more beautiful you cannot see it. 

Great eyes...hair...lips...shape of face...you are adorable. 💖
Honestly, I’m in a pretty rough patch too. The important thing is to focus on what you can do about it, and do things that make you happy. Also I absolutely love your hair!
I understand how incredibly frustrating it might be to feel lost in where you’re going in life, but you are still so young with so much future ahead of you. Take every day as it comes. You deserve to have some peace of mind.
You are stunning! Those eyes are gorgeous, and I love how you dyed your hair. It’s very cool!
Girl I’m 33 with a husband and a kid and still have no idea what I’m doing with my life! You have so so much time to figure it out. There’s no rush! You’re beautiful. Self love is hard but start looking for one thing you like about yourself each day!! You look fun and artsy!!
I absolutely adore the hair color & you have beautiful eyes as well!
I guess you have the perfect baby face. OMG , you are so adorable feminine baby faced.
You’re beautiful with cool hair! Tip to you, 18-25 years old is a weird time and don’t compare yourself to others your age.
If you knew where you were going at 19 I'd think you were crazy. Relax a minute and enjoy before you really have to be an adult. If you really do have to button down and do everything,  take it slow. The more stressed you are the more you'll mess up. Chin up gal, you can make it through
I don't know you but i know you're perfect the way you're and don't let anyone tell you otherwise <3
It’s ok to not know who you are that’s perfectly fine. Everyone gets Down and clueless I love your hair and your eyes are so pretty.
I love your hair. Also, you're really cute. You don't need to know what you're doing. I'm the same age, and I have no clue what the hell I'm doing with my life. Here's some support, and an internet hug. I'm here if you need anything.
i’m also 19f and i totally understand your struggles. we’re at the point where some people expect us to have our lives together and others treat us like children. 

you are beautiful and i love your hair! i have full confidence you will find the path that is right for you.
Your eyes are more stunning than a taser set on high.
Wowow you are beautiful!
This is temporary. You are at a rough age. Not really a kid anymore but not quite an adult either. You will be ok. And don't worry about your looks. You are really cute! I love your hair too. You will be fine. Don't worry.
Username absolutely doesn’t check out.
Your face is so soft, very beautiful. You also have really cool hair, I love the two-toned thing. Keep your head up, you’re a lovely woman and even though I cannot help you through this difficult time, I just hope you can find strength in yourself to do so
You are so beautiful and I love your hair! You are still so young, you don’t need to have everything figured out just yet, all you have to do is keep going without giving up. Everything will work out in the end, you are right where you’re meant to be right now.
I'm 18 right now, and believe me, I get it. Being between 17 and 21 are considered by many to be some of the hardest years as an adult. It'll get better, at least in my experience, that's how it works.

Your hair is really well-styled and organized, it's got a cool cotton candy (or candyfloss, depending on where you live) look going for it!
I'm 31 and I still don't know where I am going in life. Don't worry, we all feel that way.
Oh god your hair! It's amazing!

&#x200B;

Life kinda sorts itself out, just enjoy the ride!
Im pretty sure youre blind, because you look amazing
At that age I didn't know where I was going in life either. Don't beat yourself up over that. You will figure it out (putting yourself out here gives me some confidence to say that).

I do like your eyes, they have a very sincere look.
I hope things change for the better. We're not put on this Earth to just pay bills and die. Do what you can when you can and when you can do better, do better. Just one day at a time. I will raise my glass in knowing that better days lie ahead. Cheers!
Funky hair!! You’ll find your path just keep being a good person!
Yeah, 19 is def an age that sucks to go through but I'll be honest... You're awesome, your hair is awesome (I wish I can do the same actually).
You have such a kind face. I feel like being in your presence would be very calming.
You have gorgeous features and you look sweet and innocent
Your hair identifies u as an individual
Whats the best part of your body?
I remember thinking I was supposed to have it all figured out by 19. After all, you’re an adult at 18 right? Don’t worry, you actually have lots of time to work everything out! Most of my friends are still getting our shit together in our 30s. It’s okay. Life isn’t a race. 

And as far as how you look, I think you’re so cute. You have such amazing eyes!
I LOVE your hair! Everything about it <3
r/DemEyesDoe 😍
How could you hate the way you look when you have such big, beautiful eyes and perfectly pink, plump lips! You have a nice light about you. Whenever I feel down about the way I look I remember those moments when I looked in the mirror and though "DAMN, you look GOOD today!" Because we all have those moments when we're feelin' ourselves! Try to conjure those feelings when you're feeling low. I know it's difficult but you can do it! Fight for the good moments, you have more control over them than you think.
You’ve got a perfect “doll face” - that’s not something you should hate.
I like the color choices in ur hair
your eyes are so pretty and you look so kind!
Love your hair and you're so pretty ! i believe in you and you'll be able to figure stuff out when time comes. no one really knows what their doing tbh
Try not to be so hard on yourself. You’re 19, it’s okay to not have everything figured out. I’m 28 and I still second-guess myself plenty. Like anything else, confidence is a learned habit. Basically, fake it til you make it. Trust me, it works. Eventually, confidence becomes second nature. But don’t think that doubt ever fully goes away. You always have to take the bad with the good and vice versa. Again, you’re young so enjoy being young! Do what makes you happy and don’t listen to criticisms from whomever you would not take advice.
You look lovely. Please remember that no matter what happens, or how hard it gets, things will always end up the way they’re supposed to. There will come a time when you look back and realize everything was worth it, and I hope for nothing but happy days in your future.
I like your hair colours it really suits you
Of course you don’t know where you’re going in life, you’re 19! Who you are is also still being established. Being a teenager sucks frankly, but being in your 20s is so much better! I’ve been where you are, I didn’t like my teenage years and hated how I looked. But as a adult everything changed, my looks settled in so I do look better but I also don’t think the way I did as a teenager. Your hormones will calm down and you won’t have such strong feelings of despair I promise! Be kind to you.
I love your hair. The highlights, especially in the blue are fantastic.  Your skin looks so healthy, too. You don’t need to know where you’re going in life; most of us don’t. Getting hung up on thinking that there’s somewhere you need to be headed can really drag you down and distract you from the things that can bring you joy in the present. Try to find something good in this moment and just have faith that doing little things that make you happy right now will pave the way to a positive future. It sounds silly but if you force yourself to smile, it convinces your brain that you’re feeling good... and you keep feeling good for some time. Try it. Give it, like, 30 seconds.  You’ll feel like a dork but it’s one of those small things you can do right now to make a brighter later... and you deserve that!
I wish I had your eyes- They blend in so perfectly with your hair, you are absolutely gorgeous! 

Hang in there- Life has it's rough moments, however I believe in your ability to overcome them and have a fulfilling life. Start by having the best day ever today that you can- Do things you love, talk to the people who make you happy, and don't forget that being who you are is the most important part of finding self confidence and joy.
You have an incredible palate of features to play with. Makeup? No makeup? Blue hair? Pink? Brown? Auburn? I see no end to what fun you can have. Perhaps that’s why you haven’t figured out who you are. Many ppl are pigeon holed into one look. Wow. You can play with so many and still be the same cool creature that sits deep behind the controls. 
19 is a good age to play like that. (I’m 66 and ppl think I’m nuts). But so many decades to come to hone in on what finally suits your fancy. I’m kind geeked for you!
I love your hair! You will figure it out- 19 is the age for learning who you are and what you want.  Hang in there!
I hope your username doesn't mean you're calling yourself a terrible accident because you're not. I like your hair, it's awesome! I also like your eyes. They're pretty and honest and kind. You'll figure things out eventually. My dad always told me to try not to worry about anything because things always have a way of working themselves out the way they're supposed to be and I have found that to be true. If you do hugs then hugs.
Praying for you.  I love your hair.
Your hair is badass!
First off, you’ve got gorgeous eyes. And I love the dual color hair. You’re a pretty woman. 

You’re 19; you’re still becoming who you will be. So don’t sweat the lack of direction. It will come. Keep exploring the world. Try new things. Try your best not to withdraw from the world. Some of the greatest in their field didn’t start in that direction until much later in life. 

You’re going to get this sorted out because you’re smart. You came here looking for a boost and that’s a smart move. 

You’ve got this. There’s a great future ahead.
 Listen as someone who has and still is struggling with my self image I can say it gets better just do you and be yourself if you like a certain fashion style wear it and do t listen to the haters there just jealous btw love love love the hair!!!
This might sound random as far as physical compliments go but I think you have the cutest nose and lips — like, I would kill for those features as a girl myself
Sorry to hear you're having a hard time of it. You've got a pretty face, incredible lips and gorgeous eyes. Oh, and your hair rocks too :)
Cool hair!
People can always find an easy way to talk smack about someone who expresses themselves and looks different you've done nothing wrong will p.m. you
It’s totally okay to not know what you want to do. Try lots of things, think about your hobbies and what you enjoy. 

Like I enjoy aquascaping, equestrian sports and art. So in school I majored in equestrian studies and animation. 

It took me a long time to choose between horses and art as a career but I eventually figured it out and work at a game studio I love!!! 

Basically, find what you’re passionate about and chase it- you’re gonna so great!
Hey. You’re okay! I remember when I was 19. I didn’t even knew what to eat on breakfast, let alone figure out my life. But I’m 29 and things are fine. I learnt a lot and managed to get many experiences. Trust your instincts and educate yourself and you’ll be fine. 

You’re also very beautiful, blue eyes, white clean skin and full lips, I have friends who pay good money to look like you. 

You’re fine the way you are and you’ll be fine. Trust yourself.
Hey, you’re 19. You probably just got out of high school, maybe just recently started college. You’ve just gotten out of the tutorial of your life, and now you’ve taken the first step on your journey. Maybe you’ve slipped and fallen, maybe you scraped your knee a little; that’s okay, it happens. Stand back up, a little wiser, a little tougher, brush yourself off, and get moving. Sure, life sucks sometimes. But you can do anything you want to, so long as you don’t quit. You’re at the beginning of a beautiful life full of wonderful things, and even if you can’t see it now, you will go do great things. Take a deep breath, think as clearly as you can, and get moving, you beautiful human being you
Girl, those lips are to die for!  Love the hair as well!
Beautiful eyes! 🤩
I think you're realllly cute
18-22 is a really tough time, you're still getting to know who you are, and I know you might not like who you are now, but I'm sure there's a lot of people whom you matter to, and if not, there's a lot of people that would be only made better from knowing you. I don't see anything wrong with how you look, your hair looks nice, and you have pretty eyes. That being said, while I think you look lovely, a make-over might make you feel better about yourself and raise your self esteem. There's nothing wrong with changing how you look to be the best version of yourself that you can be.

&#x200B;

Never feel you have to change how you look to please someone else, change how you look because it will make you feel better. I know you'll get past all of this, so just stay strong and love yourself for who you are, and have a great day.
I’m not sure if it helps, but I’m around the same age, I’m just as lost...I think most people are. For the longest time I looked at some of my friends and said “How the hell do they have their shit together” turns out they all thought I had my shit most together...so we’re all pretty lost. You also have plenty of time to figure it out. To grow and change and to enjoy life.
You’re beautiful. You’re like a fusion between Sephiroth and a rainbow, which are two things I love. Enjoy your Day.
Your only 19... You have a long way to go and a lot of time to figure everything out. This is just the beggining! Also you have reeeealllyy nice eyes😍
I wish I had your boldness when I was your age! 19 is a tough year, tbh a tough season, because you're starting out, you're still shaping you're identity and you have everywhere to go!! It's really shitty, but these difficulties build you and the keys are to surround yourself with good people (find your people!), be kind to yourself :) You're incredible, just like your hair, so continue to be bold, experience new things and take a stand when you can. Xo
You have incredible lips and i hope you feel better!
Hey sometimes stuff happens and it seems all consuming. Keep things in perspective and reflect if this is something you can look back on and laugh. Just remember it’s either a good story to tell or a good lesson learned. You’re beautiful and have super awesome hair and eyes. You rule and are a wonderful incident the world is happy to have
Your eyes are absolutely beautiful and you have lips that some people would spend thousands trying to get
You have gorgeous, clear skin!
Firstly, you are the most kind and soothing person ever (this is your friend kayla btw).

You have a ridiculously cute face and cute image to match; you have a warm soul and a warm way; you have impeccable taste; above all you simply dont deserve the hardships you've been dealt, and that's a fact.

If you keep treating people the way you do right now, the way you treat me and others we know, you will see light soon, you must, or karma is bunk and i'll eat my hat. I'll eat your hat. I'll eat any hat I'm given. Anyone reading this in the future: if things end up poorly for this angel of a human here, feel free to PM me, I'll give you my address and you can mail me as many hats as you like I'll eat em. I'll eat those hats.

Love you darling ❤️
You have an incredibly kind looking face and just look like you are a sweetheart. Being 19 is rough but you got this girl!
You have really kind eyes
19 is tough. I had no idea where I was going in life. At 33 (34 in 2 weeks) I’m honestly still not sure. If you don’t like who you are, change it. Start doing little things to become the kind of person you want to be. 

You are so beautiful and we are all routing for you!
You rock!😊
Don't push it your young. Enjoy life while you can remember nobody is guaranteed another day
I think you look like a Disney princess.  You have one of the most naturally beautiful faces I've ever seen. Wow.
i love ur hair and ur eyes!!
You have the prettiest eyes and full lips that people would pay loads of money to have! Not to mention you have the coolest hair I’ve seen on anyone ever. It may not seem like it but things will get better I promise!
Your a young attractive lady, don’t let the past dictate your future. It appears you have a strong music collection behind you... music has gotten me through very harsh times in my life, wether it being Last Days of Humanity or KMFDM to Stravinsky. Cheers to your future endeavors!
I love your hair!
You have such kind eyes. Someday everything that you have endured will help you change people for the better. I'd be you already have, you just don't know it.
Don’t worry, there are lots of people older than you that *still* don’t know where they’re going in life. You’re self aware enough, you’ll be fine 💙

Also, I think you’re super pretty, and love your hair!
I can see that you toast others as well. You know what that makes you? A damn great person. You put in an effort to brighten the day of complete strangers. That is beautiful! You are truly wonderful, and please remember that! 

And it's so great to see that you feel better!
You are so young and have so many chances ahead of you to decide what kind of person you will be and to work for the kind of life you want. Start with achievable goals but always dream bigger.
This is a really sweet sub and I am happy that it exists.  I don't know how to make you feel better about anything except to tell you that because of you I now know this sub exists and I feel just a little bit better about this crazy world.  Good luck to you!
There’s just something about your eyebrows that I love. You look like an honest and good person who happens to be beautiful too. I feel like you could pull off so many looks - and look great in them all. Hair colors, makeup or not, clothing types, you are an awesome canvas. Probably an awkward comment but I promise I mean it in the best way, I wish I had that quality. The world is open to you.
Teenagers have it rough.  I teach HS and about half my classes have anxiety, depression and other issues.

You are lovely and obviously are sensitive.  Time will give you more answers.  You are starting to get to the age where you can shape your life like you want it.  But it is a process...don't rush it.
You are rocking the hair color! Wear it with confidence because you can work it!
Love your hair!!!
I love your hair!!!!
You look like your bound for happiness, take it one day at a time
Hang in there, babe. IT GETS SO MUCH BETTER.
19 is such a hard time.  We all go through it and I can relate.  You have so much ahead of you.  You're beautiful.  You have the cutest lips and nose and I love your hair.  I know what it's like to struggle with being kind to yourself.  I still struggle with it.  Just remember that you have value.  You're beautiful.  You have such kind eyes.  You matter.  You'll have good days, and bad days, but be kind to yourself and you'll have more good than bad.
Your lips are so plump and gorgeous and your eyebrows are the perfect shape. I can tell by your eyes that you are one of the good ones. Keep your chin up, do some form of physical activity to keep your mental health strong and the anxiety away, and talk to yourself in the mirror about your accomplishments and things you love about yourself. You can do anything you put your mind to❤️
You have the face of an angel.
You're very pretty, I really like your eyes and lips
If you are a well- educated, outgoing, polite, inquisitive person with plenty of internal drive & curiosity about your future, you should be learning continuously for all of your life.  Try to sample as much of life as you can spare, only way to gain experience that you may need later and be glad you did try something you maybe didn't think you could do.  Best of luck to you and also love those follicles emanating from you.
I wish I was as brave as you ROCKING that hair dye! I've never been brave enough to dye my hair.

You're doing great and you're enough! Just dream about where you'll be in another 19 years
You look like someone who'd be Billie Elish's younger sister 🙂
I think the fewest people really know where they want to go in their lives. Believe me, I for sure do not. And I think you are super cute! You have beautiful eyes!
You. Are. Gorgeous!
Sending much love and warmth and good energy your way 💕 you’re doing a great job and you’re going to do great things
Coming from a guy, I gotta say, you’re cute! :)
Honey your hair is beautiful.   It has a perfect part. The color is even.  And you can tell you washed it.  Your face is so cute.  I love your eyes and lips especially and I don’t even think you’re wearing makeup.
I love your hair. I’ve tried to do the two color thing and I just can’t seem to make it work, but you make it look awesome!
I love your hair
i kinda feel like everyone struggels at 19. I mean you just graduated highschool, your friends are leaving you, you're starting realize that in a year you will no longer be a teenager and now will become an adult. Its a huge stage in your life so don't expect to be easy. All I can say is to keep your head up high and keep moving forward. Find your passion and dreams in life and go for it. Don't second guess yourself and don't sell yourself out. Your life isn't over, its just beginning.
For starters, there are a lot of people who have no idea where they are going in life at 19 (I am 25 and still finding my path, and I know others older than me still finding their way). Second, your eyes are gorgeous and the shape of your lips is flawless. You are gorgeous and (although I know it is much easier to say than to feel) you shouldn't hate how you look. You are truly beautiful.

I hope your upcoming week is full of happiness and i hope you find some time to love yourself, because you deserve it! 19 is a hard time for many of us, it's a time of crazy transition and self-doubt but life keeps moving forward and if you give yourself some time you can find your footing in this world. Just remember you're not alone!
These next few years are going to change and evolve so fast, try to remember that whatever you’re feeling is always only temporary unless to fight time and try to hold on to the bad rather than seeking the good. I wish that someone had told me when I was 19 to look at my pst friendships and relationships, pick the best ones, and use those as a template. And also, don’t forget about family. I feel like I took them for granted during those days, and now I’m just trying to make up for lost time. ::hugs:: you got this, never forget that the only world that matters is the one you see. But make it a good one
19? You got a lot of time to do whatever you want. And there isnt anything wrong with how you look.
Girl, your eyebrows, lips, eyes, nose... literally everything’s perfect.
I remember 19 being tough as hell. When I was 19 I had no idea what I was doing or going either, but safe to say I eventually found my path. It took three major changes and three moves across the US. You'll find your path eventually, and it might take some tough stuff, but it WILL get better c: especially with your dope hair and absolutely huge eyes that I am super jealous of. Hang in there!
Secret: No one, not one single fucking person on this planet, actually knows what we’re doing. Anyone who tells you otherwise is oblivious or a liar (though not always malicious). Embrace it. Take a deep breath and shine.
Not to sound weird, but you have beautiful lips! 
I have typical white people lips, I would love to have bigger luscious ones! Yours are so cute!
Your hair is a perfect metaphor for life. On one hand, it's full of pain, loss, sorrow and rage. But on the other hand, it's calm, peaceful and fun! 19 is a difficult age area to go through (ik because I'm a 19M w/ autism). And you seem like the type of person who is quiet and shy in class, but when you start to know them as a person, you find out that they are a fun and awesome person!
You're 19. The vast majority of us had no idea where we were going in life at that age. Hell I still didn't really until my late 20s. Everyone does it their own way. Relax.
You have beautiful eyes, and your lips could sell lipstick!! And IMO it's pretty typical for a 19 year old to not know where she is going in life.
You look really cute to be honest :)
You genuinely look cute, and I'm not saying that just because you want to be cheered up. Most people dislike how they look but take it from a stranger: you have nothing to worry about.

And hey, you,'re 19, you have a whole life ahead of you.
Heya girl! I’m 19 too, just a gal tryin’ to make it through life. I don’t have any good advice or stuff, but I can cheer you on! Your hair is really really cute and you’ve got pretty eyes! You’ll figure stuff out! I think I know how you feel, kinda aimless and lost. But you can get through it! We both can! I’m rooting for you, and I’ll do my best too. You’re tough, you’re strong, and you’ve gotten this far! 19 years is a bunch! Almost two whole decades of just surviving. So keep on fighting and kickin’ life’s ass!!
I love the contrast between your eyes and hair. If life is easy then you are not trying hard enough. I think that you are trying hard and you are doing fine.
You look like a beautiful angel, and I love your hair. My son is 19, too, and it’s totally fine not to know where you are going in life yet. You might not know for a long time. 

It’s hard to do, and easy to say, but try not to worry too much about things like this. If you spend all your time worrying, you are missing the beauty and fun times around you. 

Hugs from an internet mom.
Man being a teenager sucks. Everyone makes you feel like you should have your whole life planned out. The crappy thing is that at 19 years old, you are facing a lot of firsts without a lot of guidance tailored to who you are and what you want. EVERYONE goes through this, whether they admit it or not. Everyone wants to fit in somewhere, everyone wants to feel like they aren't lost. However at 19, most kids have the "fake it till you make it" attitude or they act like they don't care. Its all a lie. 

Here are 3 Truths to get you through this time:

1) Everything you are facing is a temporary problem. I don't mean that it isn't important or its not a big deal, i mean that it will pass, and you will survive.

&#x200B;

2) You have a future and it is important, whether you see it or not. Everyone impacts other people. We all have the opportunity to help other people and who knows, you might be the reason someone else is alive.

&#x200B;

3) There is a God and he loves you right where you are and exactly how you are. He doesn't need you to be perfect, he just wants you to be you. 

&#x200B;

Hope this helps you!
How are you feeling today?  Any better?
You have big beautiful eyes and really fun hair! I hope that today is a better day for you
Your lips are really nicely shaped
No lie you have some of the most beautiful lips and a gorgeous pair of eyes and nose to match. You are beautiful without a doubt. Whatever it is I hate about myself I try to be kind and give myself time to work on it. I beat BAD social anxiety by making small changes over about two years. I know you can be someone you want to be too, self acceptance takes time for a lot of us. Life is crazy.. Message me if you ever want someone to talk to :)
The hair is to die for, your lips are pillowy and pretty, I love your cherub face. You are a doll!!! ❤ ❤ ❤
You have such a gentle face, you look like someone I could really let all of my feelings too. Someone I could really trust. And your shirt is hella nice
I sincerely hope that the kind words you receive here help in some way! Being a 19 year old girl is really tough, I’ve been there lol, I’m 30 now and things just get better as you get older, it becomes so much easier to just be casually confident. You’re super cute, but if you don’t like the way you look, you can change that! Don’t think that changing your appearance is a slight to your personality or something. I spent sooo many years of my teens/early 20’s straight up neglecting my appearance because I didn’t want to be one of “those girls” who cared about her appearance that much. Well, surprise, turns out when you do things that make you appear better, it will make you feel better! I wish I learned sooner that sometimes you just need to kind of change everything to make things easier on you. It’s not a betrayal to who you are at all. Personality shouldn’t ever be based on appearance. Ugh sorry for the rant but honestly girl I think you’re beautiful and a little lost and that’s okay, just try and remember that things will get better!
19 is so hard. You'll find your way. Chin up, love.  You're a beautiful young woman. I'm almost half your age, and I'm still trying to figure out where I'm going. ❤️
cheer up buttercup ur cute as hell and 19 aint an easy age I know. But you gotta remember the silver linings. even if it seems ridiculous or its hard to see at all. and im not talking about false optimism, im talking about trying to see what u can get out of every crappy situation to benefit u. it might be hard but its a good exercise nonetheless. good luck my love.
I just have to say that I love your hair! I don't even know how to describe it, but they are very nice colors. You have beautiful eyes and lips that I am jealous of haha. I love that you chose not to wear makeup for the picture, it looks very nice. You seem like a kind and absolutely beautiful person. Sorry so much of this was about looks, I hope that you are feeling a little better!
Listen you might not know it, but those eyes are killers. My dad told me eyes like that always snag the real ones, but first you have to open up your face. Pull your hair back, smile a lot, and try to draw attention to those beautiful orbs. Trust me, it is the best feature a parent can give.
It’s totally OK to not know where you’re going in life at age 19. Most people don’t. In fact, even those who think they *do* know usually end up in a 100% different place than they expected 10-20 years from
Now. You’ve got plenty of time. <3

Love your hair, by the way, and you legit have lovely facial features.
How can you hate yourself?!? You look beautiful!!!
Don’t worry, you’re gonna do great!

Source: I was 19 once and I turned out fine :)
Ur hair is SO cool! I love when people do 2 different colors! And ur eyes are amazing!
You’re adorable!
Whatever is happening, I know that you'll get through it and you will be okay. I hope things get better for you!
I'm in a similar situation, so please forgive me for kind of being a hypocrite, but you have to learn to love yourself. If you aren't happy with your look, play around with whatever you don't like. Whether it's makeup, clothes, etc. Have have fun with it (somewhat related though: I LOVE your hair color, I wish I could pull that off!). I don't know where I'm going in life either, but you're young and there is plenty of time to figure out what direction you want to take. Take some career quizzes and see what fits you best, if you aren't happy with those results research some careers that you find to be interesting. Or is there a hobby or yours that you could do something with? Look into that! It will take time, but you've got time and there is no rush. 
 
I hope you have a good week, and keep your head up!
19 year old me could not have possibly conceived of how awesome my life is today, nor how I achieved it

Take things a day at a time and congratulate yourself for the little things you do every day. 

You'll get there eventually. 

Hang in there! 

You also have the most striking eyes.
I'm 44 and have never had an idea what I want to be if I ever grow up.

I think that you are pretty, but remember that looks aren't what make people great. I get praised for working hard at my job, for solving difficult problems. At home I get praised for selflessly doing things for my wife, for loving her for who she is and not wanting her to be someone she isn't. I accept her completely, like I have to accept myself and love myself too.

You can love yourself too, but I can certainly understand how distant that can feel. It took me until moving out to my own place away from toxic family to be able to breathe and think about who I am. I hope you can do that too.

Some things to think about: do you like helping people? Are you competitive? Do you like being around people? Dealing with strangers? Do you deal well with conflict or do you do everything to avoid it? How do those things make you feel, and *why* do you feel those things? Remember that life wouldn't be interesting if we knew all the answers and all the spoilers!

You're still near the beginning of your life's journey. I think that you will do just great!

If you ever want to ask about stuff, PM me.
I spent my teenage years hating myself, brooding and thinking I was alone in life. Things get better. 

You seem like a person who has a lot to offer the world. And very cool hair. :)
I think you are really adorable and you hair is awesome :)
You have lovely eyes and your hair is very cool, just take one day at a time life can be tough but try to let the positive outshine the negative :)
Hey so just wanted to say that you seem like a very interesting person. You're probably really into music or something like that, and that's awesome! 

It can be hard to not think negatively about yourself - I'm still learning, I'm only 19 too. But you have a long, long life ahead of you. It's certainly not too late to ask for help. There's tons of places to go to get help deciding what you want to be, community colleges, libraries, or even online. But just keep at it, and you'll be happy that you did!

Sorry this probably isn't worded well, I'm pretty tired lol. Btw I love your hair, and you're also really pretty! Hope the best for you ☺
Take it a day at a time.
First: don't ask people to be kind. You deserve kindness and should walk away for anything less. Second: that hair looks like some awesome cotton candy. Sport that hair everywhere.
You look good
You have a beautiful face. Don't distract from it with coloured hair. I'm sure your natural colour is awesome too.
Ya'know. I'm going through some tough shit too. My former best friend just out and yeeted me out the window. But anyway, I love your hair and the general shape of your face.
Your hair is fantastic!!!! Secondly, 19 is rough. I made some of the stupidest mistakes at 19 but know what? I don’t regret them now. I am happy at 26 and wouldn’t be here had I changed anything in the past. You will get through. Also, don’t take anyone’s shit. Families, friends, no ones. Also, family is who you choose. Relatives are who you’re stuck with.
Awe you are an awesome lady with a beautiful face and just take some time for yourself and take care of yourself. Remember you can do great things.
You have insanely beautiful eyes!
The colors in your hair bring out the blue in your eyes, and you have lovely eyes! It's a great look on you.
Girl, you are so young.  And NONE of us know where we're going in life.  We might think we do, but I'm 31 and I have no clue where I'm going!

You're a beautiful girl with youth on your side.  Don't ever settle for something that you don't feel right about in your gut - not a man, not a job, not a home situation.  Always strive for better.

I'm not sure what you're going through, but I know things always seem horrible, but they have a way of working out.  Sending some good vibes your way!  ❤️
You're cute as heck!! Wooooow!!!!

And I love your hair. Not everybody can pull that off and it often looks stupid on people who try, but you ROCK that look!! I'd hit on you in a heart beat, and then you'd probably shoot me down LOL.

Feel free to PM me sometime if you ever need someone to chat with. I might be able to give you some cool life advice too, as I was once aimless and lost, not so long ago.
Same 19m here got serious anxiety about my past mistakes. How am I supposed to look forward to the future when i cant forget how much of a dickhead i was. 

Advice ppl give me is to learn to forgive myself. 

Good thing about anxiety is that now you know you, you can't make the same mistakes again. It gets better.
I think you look super sweet... If you feel like doing something that might help YOU to see yourself similarly, maybe try having your eyelashes tinted blue-black...it looks to me as though you have long beautiful lashes that aren't very dark at the ends (like me) It's the only beautifying thing I bother with myself (sometimes) because I'm much older than you and have the confidence in my appearance that I found became easier with age...

BELIEVE IT AND YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL! PS do you ever try parting your hair slightly to one side or the other? I reckon that'd look awesome with the complementary colours you got at the moment!

PPS your lip shape is one of the classics-your features are gorgeous chickie! 😊
I love your hair!
You are the cutest fucking thing ive ever seen. Wtf?
Your hair is amazing as you are
You don’t deserve what’s being thrown at you 
You have a lot to live for your family and friends if you don’t have neither you have your fav food your fav movie your fav etc keep it up you got this
I hope you are ok just be you...we are all different...not every one gets along ...everyone struggles learning who they are...this process takes time and I think you look superb also I love your eyes simply stunning
You look absolutely beautiful,  and dont worry about where you are headed, just enjoy the journey along the way... that's what it is all about... life is what you make!
First thing I will say... I love your hair... I actually had it the same a few years ago.

Second thing... I'm older than you and I have days where I feel like I am stuck,, but you will have days where it makes sense.

Thirdly and lastly... Don't hate how you look... Embrace it... You are a pretty thing and maybe you need to find a new style that makes you feel like you :).
Full lips and button nose, I’m jealous 😭😭😭
Why do you say you hate your looks? You have the prettiest face!

I like your hair too. You've got a cool vibe. You're the kind of person I'd like to hang out with.
1) you look great 2) no one at 19 knows where they are going in life :)

You're gonna be fine .
Most people don’t know where they are going in life. You are fine. As long as your trying to do better, your going in the right direction.
It might not get better today. It probably won't. Tomorrow might even be worse. But, IT GETS BETTER. You are valuable.
Hey there. I’m 25 and have no idea where I’m going in life!!! Don’t focus so much on your destination or what your purpose is, just try to enjoy your day to day life. I didn’t know what I wanted to do at your age (still don’t) so I just got an ordinary office job. It’s only the last few years I’ve started having specific interests and knowing what I might want to do. You have heaps of time to work it out. NO ONE knows what they want at your age, even if they think they do, it’s likely gonna change as they experience the world more.
Don’t put any pressure on yourself!
Also I’d pay to have your lips xx
Love your hair and you have a gorgeous face!
I love the cotton candy XXXtentacion hair color😎

I was just browsing Reddit for fun and I came across this comment. Even I'm 19 and I needed this comment. I'm gonna sleep peacefully now.
Other teenage redditors also needed to know this! Thankyou!
Great advice
Nicely said
I was thinking the same thing! Those eyes! Fabulous lips! Perfect skin. It will get better.
You’re super cute and have your whole life ahead of you to experience good and bad things. I hope you gain a positive outlook on the roller coaster of life, because we ride it anyway! Hold someone’s hand if you need to!
Some of the most wonderful, fun people don't still know what they're doing at age 40. I think the "figuring it out' turned out to be learning how to just "ride the ride of life". :)

Agree....beautiful eyes, face, and super kind with coming to toastme!
Seriously!  

Nineteen was probably the hardest year of my life, but it resulted in a lot of personal growth!
Let’s not devalue someone’s personal issues purely because of their age. Lets not devalue them at all. :)
This is not a toast. This is not r/advice. Please see the rules and post accordingly.
Trust me as a fellow teenager I can say with confidence. Life will throw you shit and it may suck but that doesn’t have to stop you from having fun. Feeling down - go do something you have fun doing. Don’t let others tell you what you should be doing sometimes you need to just listen to yourself.
Right? Ugh she’s beautiful.
Ayyy teenagers rise uppppp
Your smile is infectious!! Keep smiling:)
Your smile is fucking gorgeous.
That UFO patch is so cool! I want it haha. Have a great day!
You look like a really expensive stock image that would come up when you search "happiness teen rainbow" on Google
Very cute smile that inspires happiness!
awesome smile dude! i’m getting braces put on soon and i’m nervous that there going to look ridiculous on me, this definitely was a boost seeing how you rock them! :~)
You seem really confident! Nurture that part of yourself, it will serve you well.
Hope you had fun watching X-files. You look like you have lots of friends and they all think you are the best!
Aaaaah I love your hair! It’s like perfectly tousled. Also nice wrist candy.
Your smile makes me smile. I'm imagining that you have the same energy irl.
To the scene kid! Seeing you this happy as you are now makes me hopeful for the future when you're the ones in charge of things. (That day can't come fast enough.) Stay awesome.
youre such a beautiful creature !!!!! you look so friendly and kind. keep smiling :)
The way you express yourself is inspiring. I love the colors!
Your smile is so amazing and genuine, don’t ever lose that pure happiness. Right away you just seem like such a kind soul. Your colorful bracelets are awesome! I use to stack bracelets like that on my arms, but they were the rubber ones that said “Livestrong” and things like that, if you know what I’m talking about. I completely forgot about doing that until I saw your picture, and I got that warm/fuzzy nostalgia feel. Don’t let the world ever keep you down, because we need more sunshine like the kind you bring. <3
YOU ARE SO CUTE! And you got a really cool sense of style too, you're awesome!
You’re so cute
Hey buddy. Sending you as much love, happiness, and encouragement to get you through the next week.

I gotta say that based on your picture, you seem like a great guy to be around. Also, your furry character designs are pretty sweet. (It’s not my scene, but I have to say that they are objectively cool)

Take it easy friend. 

Cheers.
I love your UFO patch! and dont think I didnt see the alien sticker thingy either. Any chance I will be seeing you this september in Area 51?

&#x200B;

your smile is contagious, keep smiling. I love your UWU, furry and minecraft bracelets. minecraft is pretty fun ngl.
u have such a cute smile and i like how ur eyes do that thing while ur smiling aw
Buddy you made me smile!! You are amazing!
This is the happiest photo I've seen today :D You keep being you kid, and of course keep being awesome! <3 xx
Haven't seen a genuine looking smile like this in a while.
Looks great!
the jewelry takes me back. I wish I had pictures of me from my teens when I was doing the same thing LOL this actually made me smile a lot thank you
:DDD!! thank u!!!!
\>_< 
 An UwU has been identified! That makes 2358 UwUs in the last 27 days! 
 ^(Blep. Blop. I am a bot!)
I would also like instructions on how you get your hair like that. 
Please and thanks.
bedhead and a quick but hard shake of my head!! hahah
3 years??? You don’t look old enough for all that. Don’t waste time dwelling on the ones who hurt you. But never forget the bastard name
Take that rotten toast and throw it in the trash, and start over with a happy, friendly, positive one. Have a great day, I hope you get rid of all the bad Karma in your life.
Honestly, if you’re looking for a new partner, half of Reddit has got you beautiful. Stay strong <3
You are beautiful! Look beyond these things to see that so much good is coming in your life.
time heals all wounds. if your partner was asshole enough to end 3 years in 3 minutes over the phone, you deserves better all along anyways!!

you’re young and got your whole life ahead of you, take time to heal, allow yourself to be sad and process what has happened, no shame in that :) and when you’re ready be selfish for a while, do what makes YOU happy! it’s hard to stay in touch with yourself in such a serious relationship at a young age, you have the opportunity to really get to know and love yourself now, without having to worry how it will affect your partner :)
Oh, I'm so sorry. That must really be tough. The sleep deprivation doesn't help either but I'm sure no one realizes this like you. Try to get some electrolytes into your system. You're probably a bit dehydrated as well.

Yeah, just to reiterate what's already been said: don't waste your time with that loser. Real people don't break up via phonecalls. Go get yourself someone real. Have high standards. Nobody ends a relationship like that with a phonecall. You deserve better than that. But you've made this is far, and you're still standing! Here's to you! Strong, independent, and obviously out of most men's league! Take your time to heal but never forget that you deserve to have high standards. Cheers to you!
You look like Thora Birch in Ghost World. I love Ghost World, I love Thora Birch. Your eyes are sad, but your smile sincere and kind. You're a fine person.
The fact that you already at least try to smile keeps me positive, that you will get through this. You got this.
 That’s a shitty thing for your ex to have done. You deserve better.
Thought I'd do this cause it would cheer you up, but this boy of yours, was he ever really good enough? But you have to know that you are tough, you have a life without him, and I hope that's good enough, but you needed a toast, that thing he said, was a total dose, but the mind can wander, the mind's fucking gross, it makes you worry, it makes you see close, but you need to see, the world without him and you, it has made you really blue, but you can make it through, like all strong minds do.
Without knowing what was said in the phone call at least he respected you enough to actually make a call and not just text. Im sure you will find someone again when the time is right. You managed to be with someone for 3 years so their is obviously alot of good things about you when so many relationships these days barely make it past 1 month.
Just try to see the next person for who he is and not for the person that you just ended with
A very genuine smile you got. Carry it as much as you can :)
You didn't deserve that. You will get through this! I believe in you <3
You look lovely and so does that artwork behind you, you have good taste. It will get easier.
You deserve so much better. Don't let them keep you crying, they deserve no more tears from you. Try devoting the next few weeks to be about you as much as you can, do things that make you happy, and forget about that person. You are young and you will find love again if you want, or you can be perfectly content and happy alone and doing things for yourself. People put a real stigma on being alone, but I think we can be just as fulfilled living for ourselves and by ourselves, but if it helps, you can also put your love into pets.
Everything happens for a reason and for the best.  Try reading or listening to this book:  101 questions to ask before you get engaged.  And it all will start making sense to you.
Hey girl you are now on the low and i still think you are very cute! Imagine on the best day you will be radiantly beautifull.
Breakups are hard, but time heals all wounds. Allow yourself to be sad for now. Wallow in it for a few days. And then pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and focus on the things in your life that make you happy. You look strong, you can get through this.
When I dealt with one of my harder break ups, someone gave me the advice to take the time to focus on self improvement and I found that really helped. You might find yourself with extra time now that you could spend doing some things you have wanted to do but didn’t have an opportunity to start. It will help to keep your focus off the relationship and to regain your confidence, if it’s been damaged by this unfortunate event.

I really do believe that every relationship we have gets us closer to the one that we are meant for because we learn a lot about ourselves and others from those experiences. I don’t think they are failures but rather just issues of compatibility and I believe you’re one step closer to finding the right match when you’re ready. 

Hope you feel better soon. Make sure reach out to your friends and family for support also. ☺️☀️

EDIT: P.S. Your skin is perfect.
Positive Vibes 💛
There's so many compliments I could give you for how good you look but my brain just wants me to talk about how lovely your handwriting is LMAO
 Oh how can someone leave that beautiful smile . Stay strong girl (well you're already strong cause you can smile at least ).If it ended by a 3 minutes phone call then you shouldn't waste much time and move on .
You are precious and beautiful. Your hair looks amazing btw. くコ:彡Squiddy loves you
Man, I wish I had your haircut! It's a style that doesn't look good on everybody, but to you... It really feels natural! Plus, checking on your profile, it looks like you're struggling with the fact that you feel a bit feminine (you don't, btw), but I guess it'll go away. I mean, you just had your surgery, it'll take time to feel right externally as you do internally. Who cares about other boys? Facial beauty is just a small part of the concept of beauty in this society, I assure you there are a lot of other aspects that matter. And to be honest, I'm a guy and I've got no shame telling you you're gorgeous! Anyway, one of the things I envy about transgender people (as once Ricky Gervais said) is that they understand what's so wrong about them and they get to fix it, by changing their gender! How amazing must you feel! And if not, you should, because you've been very brave to make such an important step in such a young age, and you somehow managed to look stunning! Be proud! I don't know what you're into, but believe me if I say that soon someone is gonna notice how beautiful you look inside and outside. You need more friends? Bro, I'm here! I know it's not much, but that's all I can do, so if you wanna chat, my PM's are open! I know that soon you'll find other friends in the real life as well, but for now, I'm here, bro!
YOURE CUTE
Honestly you look way cuter than most boys
you look great! as a hairdresser I would ask about getting a fauxhawk cut, all that glorious hair would make it gorgeous
Your hair looks so good though? It looks like it's so nice and fluffy, makes me wanna touch it, lmao, :P
The first picture though... your eyes look so determined! I bet you can do anything you set your mind to, believe in yourself!
Man you're way better looking than I am! In fact I'd say you're more attractive than most of the guys I know!
Hey man dont wanna chat but if you believe in yourself and you are friendly and welcoming all the good will happen to you. If you would towards me on a festival for sure i had a talk with you. You are not offputting in any way.
You’ve got really nice hair! I personally think the cut looks pretty good. It might take some time, but hopefully you find one you’re comfortable with. I’m actually jealous, I’m losing my hair at 25. Best of luck to you ❤️😁
Wait a second bro. You're actually hella attractive. And the haircut looks dope on you. Not a lot of people can pull it off.
I think you’re cute af! I love your eyes and lips. And I think your hair looks nice, like I would constantly run my hands through it and be messing it up.
I think your haircut looks great and you’re really handsome :0 I’m also a trans guy (19) & if you need someone to talk to about anything or just a friend, feel free to PM me :)
You're hot and the haircut is def making a Weeknd vibe rn. I love it, but if you hate it (give it a few days) someone suggested afauxhawk type deal that would be hot af too!
You look great! Try not to spend too long worrying about what other people look like because I promise everyone else is worrying about how they look too at times :)
What?! Cause I think you are totally pulling off that cut and is that a fade? Rock it with confidence!
I dunno man, i see your hair and it just looks like a regular guy haircut to me. Nothing wrong with it. Good thing about being male is that the only important thing your hair has to do is exist.
That haircut really suits you! You have a really handsome face, you don’t need to compare yourself to others, you already look fantastic.
You're fine, Handsome. Life has its ups and downs. Part of enjoying the rollercoaster ride of life is being able to eventually being able to expect the downs. I'm sorry it's been hard for you lately (and probably for a long time before now) but you got control of this. Whether you realize it or not, your eyes do not deceive you: you are handsome and you're smart because you've always been smart. 
It's time do make sure your rollercoaster is going up; get up for the day, do one thing productive (no matter how small), then get something to eat, then go do one thing for yourself. Get a new accessory, a new book (or check one out at a library), or hang out with/ try to make a new friend. Everything you don't already have is outside your front door. You need to be on the other side of it (hopefully dressed and with a full stomach and plenty of water on a day like today). You deserve better. Here's to you being strong! And here's to you being able to surprise yourself by realizing your true potential! Cheers!
You look like the coolest indie rocker since The Strokes were a thing. You're like all of The Strokes in one person. You're cool in my book.
your jawline is sharp af
You are seriously gorgeous
Are you sure you were ever a girl? I mean seriously...
You are being too hard on yourself. I think you look great. A young and handsome boy indeed.
thank you !
thank you man. 

and lol, i havent had surgery yet, im getting surgery in a few months hahah. but im on testosterone (hormone replacement) since 1 year and a half now. haha.

but anyway thank you, its hard to feel pride when i still dont feel like i have changed enough. 

and alright, ill message you if i ever feel the need to :)
i wish that were true, but seriously, thank you
i have naturally very curly hair, so its hard to style my hair a certain way. the way it was cut specifically makes it so that when my curls naturally curls, it looks super weird. i originally wanted a curlyhawk, but got to nervous to ask for one haha.. so i let him do whatever, ... a mistake lol
sorry about your hair loss :( some people say bald men are more attractive anyway..

but thank you
thank you. hahaha, there have been some people who want to play with my hair, but not too many. lol
okie, thanks for letting me know. ill pm you when i feel the need to, when i get lonely or bored enough hahaha
haha, thank you
thank you :)
My pleasure. ^_^
I really think you’re cute
you can totally pull off a fauxhawk then. I just did one this week on a curly haired kid. super friggin cute. I would have taken a pic but as an apprentice I can't advertise my services yet. my instagram has suffered for that. 
I would rec seeing a curl specialist though. someone who has devacurl training or something similar, only because curly hair is tricky and needs a lot more care.
for ex: I dry cut most curly hair and cut WITH the curl, and if it's thick I do chicken pickin. don't ask, its a Redken thing LOL
Edit: I can english I swear
yeah, i just dont know where to find people who know how to handle my hair. some can, some cant. its a bit frustrating not knowing whither or not im going to be getting a good or a bad cut, due to their inexperience with my hair type
its all in the consult. if you dont get a good consultation where you are on the same wavelength gtfo. I would offer to do it but im in canada aha
lol, im in canada as well. and yeah i get it, i gotta be more careful. but i usually have the "its just hair" mindset lol
oh nice! im in shitario. planning on being out west or montreal in a couple years
Smile, beard and hair is a solid 10/10.
You look like a chill guy to be around, your general demeanor in this picture is very welcoming. Your eyes, smile, posture- you look fun and accepting.

Im sorry that life is tough for you at the moment but I know you'll find the inner strength to be able to climb out of the terrible hole you're in.

&#x200B;

EDIT- You look like Mac from 'Its always Sunny in Philadelphia' & thats good because you're a total cutie
You’re adorable! Your smile could make my day. It feels like summer.
Your smile looks genuine to me! Thank you for smiling even if you don't feel like it.
You should smile moe because you be looking smooth my friend. Dig the shirt. Hope you find what ever you are looking for.
10 points. Dude I love the shirt.
You would never see that that smile is forced, such a beautiful and kind face. I hope you find the light again
You’re smile is so stunning! It made me smile. Your eyes frame your smile so beautifully
You are a good person and a lovely bean. Squiddy loves you. くコ:彡
You've got a very approachable face, one that people can be comfortable with. Try not to lose the teeth and you will do just fine :D
cute smile
You’re a really good looking guy and I love the shirt!
I’m glad you smiled even if you had to force it, because you have an amazing smile, and i feel a bit happier because of it. I hope that is you persevere you will finally get what you’re looking for and find happiness.
I know what it feels like to force a smile... I'm sorry you are struggling right now. But you know what, it's not always like this. It's not always this hard. And right now be kind to yourself, it's ok that it's hard and it's ok that you're struggling. Everyone struggles. But if you remember that people love you, even total strangers who will write a comment like this, you can see that it gets better. You're an amazing, valuable human and I'm glad that you're alive and you're you.
I'm digging the vibe you're putting off, my dude. I'd be your friend irl. Hang in there for the good days, there will be some soon. Take care of yourself.
Your forced smile warms my heart, and anyone who can work a pineapple shirt is a guy who deserves the sweetness that life has to offer—and all the things he wants for himself. You are not worthless, nor useless. You are a kind-hearted soul who makes the world better. Take good care.
You have a beautiful smile and I absolutely LOVE your shirt !
Yea i know that feel sometimes. But staying happy  is one of the hardest things in life and you surely would make me happy if you honesty smiled cause of me.
Even though you had to force it you have a lovely smile and very kind eyes. I’m sorry you’re dealing with so much, but I’m proud of you for reaching out to a group like this for help. I love the shirt and you’ve got really nice hair too! I hope things start to turn around, much love to you
Dang man, I love your shirt
I’m sorry you’re struggling, I’ve been there and it’s taken a lot of work to find things that help me, so I hope you can too. You have really kind eyes and even if it was forced you’re smile is so warm and friendly.
You look like the most honestly fun person at a wedding. You're cool by my account.
Aw, you have a great smile, you should do it more, it actually can trick the mind into being happy. You also have very kind looking eyes, and amazing pineapple shirt! You are far from worthless, each person can contribute to the world around them, even the smallest of things can make someone elses life better. I know you can make a big impact on the world around you, and be good to yourself! Try doing things that'll make you happy, be great to yourself, the world needs amazing people like you in it, and to be happy! Have a great day. :)
Even your forced smile is lovely, can only imagine how your genuine smile is! I know it's hard, trust me, but I truly hope you brighten the world again with your proper smile
Hey friend! I also struggle from depression so I know exactly how that feels.... the last few months for me have been that rollercoaster as well. Just please remember how loved and wanted you are. I know it’s so hard to believe that in the periods when we feel the most worthless and useless but i promise there are people out here who love and appreciate you as a person and want you in their lives. I really hope you feel better and like yourself again soon, if you ever need anyone to talk to or vent to please let me know! Otherwise just have a fantastic week! 

Ps: your smile is so so cute even if it is forced haha. I love your taste in shirts too!
You've got a kind face. I hope things get better for you soon
You look like a funny guy in a comedy.
You definitely have the face for smiling, my dude, so here's to hoping you get plenty of reasons to smile from here on out!!
You’ve got such a kind face :) (and it let’s be real you’re FIT)
And the shirt is awesome!
Thank you both!
Haha thanks! Mac is my favorite character
Haha thanks!
Thanks, I watched a TED talk a few months ago about how much of an impact smiling for
Just 2 minutes a day can have on your mental health so, trying my best!
Thanks friend

Thank you!
Thank you!
Haha that’s a unique one, thanks!
Thank you
Thanks :/
Yes indeed! So keep smiling dear sir!😊
Hope you’re doing ok <3
I’m trying my hardest
When you find out what you want to do and what you're good at, all of this will go away ... and that WILL happen. I had to go through a few jobs where I felt the same as you all the time, constant anxiety, always thinking I wasn't good enough ... imposter syndrome, essentially. But there *is* something out there you will rock at and that you'll love, and you *will* find it if you just keep at it and keep following your desires.

I believe in you.
49 here. Don't know what I want to do. It's gonna be ok. You are pretty and wanted.  Think happy thoughts. We need you!
Anyone could get lost in your eyes
I love your eyes. Hugs, you will find the thing you love and someone to share it with later
Wow. I could stare at those eyes till infinity and beyond :)
Is smol. And veri adorabul!
Take care pls, you are young, take ur time, dont put yourself down. Always be positive. U r a wonderful girl, full of energy, happiness and moreover you are pretty
I would kill for your eyes. They are stunning
Enjoy this day, we dont even are sure if we have tomorrow. Enjoy it, do what you love and everything else will fall in its place. Suddenly you will know what you want to do, and if not, it doesnt matter cause in the end the most important thing are family and friends and the time we spend with them. Hope you feel better now.
You’re way too young to know “what I want to do”. You’ll figure it out eventually 

Take it easy. It’s not a sprint.
It all starts with a dream. Life experience comes from mistakes. Without knowing failure, you will never know success. Love yourself. Ummm... I ran out of feel good stuff to say, this isn't my forté lol

I just retired from the military after 26 years of service and I still don't know what I want to be when I grow up. So in the meantime, I doing what I know and enjoy.
Who knows what the furture holds just work on the now and it will help you in the long run. Life is a mystery and i hope you solve yours.  Your eyes look warm and gooey like a chocolate dessert. Stay cool and think more about the positive aspects of your life .
You aren't alone in not knowing what you want to do with your future. However, you'll find something you love, even if you have to try a few different things to get there. For now, you can work on trying to love yourself. You're beautiful, and capable of great things! Also, great eyes, holy shit.
This happens to everyone-- you are not alone!

&#x200B;

Right now, focus on the things you can control, and remember that happiness is not a destination. It's not joy or excitement either. It's contentment, peace and gratitude.  These things take TIME! 

&#x200B;

You can do this! <3
Hey you look just past my surface into my soul and its great any guy could fall for that anytime. Also having a conversation with you would probably make me feel very special. (not interested in chat just what i would feel if we would meet(not interested in meeting i have a gf))
You are super gorg! Every part of you is gorgeous! You have amazing eyes, first off. Amazing is an adjective that keeps coming to mind. Your hair, skin, lips, nose, eyebrows, and everything else can all be fairly described as amazing. You have a very very nice figure and I can’t imagine not immediately noticing you in any room you walk into. You’re the kind of person who turns heads. If you look for it you’ll see it. I guarantee you will. You really do have plenty of reason to be confident. People notice you. I can tell you that for sure. It’s not because you’re awkward or you seem odd or anything like that though. It’s because you’re very very pretty. That’s not a bad position to be in. It’s a pretty good start, in fact.
You have hair that people would envy and you have pretty big blue or grey eyes.
Sometimes, our brain is not our friend. You were born good enough. Live up to your heart’s expectations. It has great things in store for you. Look in the mirror, acknowledge you are a beautiful woman who will not be defeated by the nonsense that is your brain’s bad day. It takes practice. Take good care. Xo
You're stronger than you think. The depth behind your eyes that is filled with negative thoughts will not disappear if you throw the thoughts out, it will remain but filled with something warmer and wiser.
It most have taken a lot of courage to post something and I’m proud and happy you did. Although you might have negative thoughts and idea but know there are people who say otherwise. I would love to hear what’s going on with your thoughts and your ideas of your future and hear you out
I hope you can get rid of Anxiety toast and turn it in to a super one to the point where you can be calm, and happy
33 here. I´ve figured out what i want to do in small pieces. First it was music(more than 15 years ago), still is and it brings balance to my life. About 6 years ago i went through few therapy sessions and there i was asked if i´ve made 5 year plan or similiar, i hadn´t. For the next session i was prepared. It took few days to figure out what i want to do for living, what i want to do with my freetime, where do i live etc. 

&#x200B;

Without putting any conscious work to it, 6 years later i´m now there. i only took the first step by getting a degree from school and things kind of escalated. 

&#x200B;

What i´m trying to tell you with my "history lesson" here is that when you figure out what you want to do and who you want to do it with and where you want to do it, you´ll get there at some point. I´m 100% sure of it. There´s no fire without a spark :)
Your 18, have a good relationship, an adorable puppy.  At your age i would say life is good.  If you plan on university get going under general studies for a year or so and maybe touch on a class or 2 per semester that is a field your curious about.  What kind of work you do now?  Love travel go marketing or management, and when you turn 21 apply to be a flight attendant.  Like to get your hands dirty aircraft maintenance engineer, even pilot.  Empathetic when loved ones are sick maybe nursing or healthcare.  At your age you are limited by only what your dreams and imagination.  Let them guide you and you can accomplish anything.
Thank you ♥️
RIGHT THOUGH!??!?
V smol ♥️
Thank you! I’m trying, it’s just hard
Goon on you! I am proud. My anxieties make it hard, I am trying it’s just hard.
I feel like I stay in my comfort zone too much out of fear. I’m trying to venture out it’s just very difficult! Thanks ♥️
Too much time! Thank you though ♥️
Green :p
I’m trying. It’s just hard to push away all the negativity. Thank you ♥️
Feel free to dm me 😊
I wish help u, I wish be there
I completely understand. My ex-wife had such a problem with her anxiety that she rarely left the house. It was hard for her to make friends. She went to school to be a veterinary assistant, and only managed to work for a couple weeks because of her anxiety. She didn't drive, so while I was deployed was extremely difficult for her. 

I have a feeling though, that you'll get this figured out. I believe in you!
I’m in such a similar situation to her?! Like I don’t drive, I wanted to be a vet, I can’t make friends! Am I your wife?
Idk... You could be! lol
YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL I JUST WANNA FEED YOU PUMPKIN PIE
I like the glasses and your hair. You have a nice smile. And you’re brave to ask for some support when you need it.
Hey that days probably ended and the next day will be better.
A good rest often helps me on a bad day. Try that with other self care. Also, if those trophies in the back are yours that’s impressive!
Bad days are the worst.  Your hair is gorgeous, you look like you are epic at trivia nights with those glasses and would totally thrash the competition!
I hope your bad day gets better! Your eyes are so stunning, they’ve got a kind soft look to them
I'm sorry your day was rough. The fact that you wrote it down and asked for support means you'll never be down for long! Try again tomorrow <3
You'll get through this. I know you will.
You have a lovely smile and your glasses suit you so well. I wish I looked that good when I was 12! Tomorrow’s a new day:)
You ma'am are a beautiful, gentle and kindhearted woman who makes other people smile and feel loved.  You must also be exceptionally talented as evidenced by those two big trophies behind you.
I wish I had that wavy type of hair like you have. It’s something I’ve always wanted naturally. It’s hard to achieve being biracial, with more ethnic hair than not.
Thank you!! I don't really eat pie but I will certainly accept it!!!! 💞💓
Thank you!! I've always been nervous about my looks so that really helps!!! 💙
Thank you! You're right about that💟
Thank you!! I've been struggling with sleep lately, so I'll definitely work on it. And yeah, those are my trophies. I don't take karate anymore, but they're from tournaments. Thanks!!! ❤
Thank you!!! I do know a lot of useless little facts from being online so much, so maybe I would do well! 🖤
Thank you! I've always been a little worried about my appearance being that I'm in that teenage awkward phase, so that really helps! 💜
Thank you!!! I'll keep working and soon I'm sure it'll all be better. 💕
Thank u for the support!! 💛
Thank you!!! I've always been a little insecure about how I look, so that really helps!!! 💚
Thank you so much!!! I always try my best to lift others when they are down. 💓
Thank you!! I'm sure with a little bit of work you can get your hair like mine. I'm not very good with my hair (I struggle literally washing it) so it's a miracle that it's like this. Keep trying!! 💝
Karate is a great hobby you should go into training again!
We need more people like you.
💞💞💞
Is that the Bi flag in the background? Also, you have really pretty eyes. And don't take the other people's insults too seriously
Yo man! Life gets better my man. Everyone has their ups and downs, and yeah it sucks that you are down on your bday, but there is always tomorrow. You grab onto tomorrow and have a great day. Go do something simple but gives you a set of accomplishment. Hold onto even the smallest glint of good, don’t slip back into the darkness where you find yourself all alone.
Ona different note... yo man, that blue hair is cool as hell.
Here's an internet hug. I'm sorry this happened. Also, I'm digging the blue hair
Nothing wrong with spending birthdays alone man. Chill out, make the best of it. Make it a birthday week, birthday month. Birthday's are just another day. You can choose to celebrate your life anyday of the year. I've been there, in a bad spot on my bday, alone, crying, just sulking in depression and a negative headspace. Sometimes you have to go there. Learn what you can from these dark episodes. And yes, sometimes they land on your bday. Just explore the reasons you fell so hard emotionally. Be real with yourself. Then move on. Life is tough man. You've gotta go through the slime, sometimes the worst of the worst before you can come back up and properly enjoy yourself.
Hey, man. 

Maybe you missed the memo, but being socially awkward is where it's at these days. You're just ahead of the curve. 

Never let anyone make you feel underappreciated and unvalued, because I think you're pretty wonderful, and I hope you each day is better than the last.
I prefer this side of the spectrum. Also, who isn't awkward? I think awkwardness is what makes us us.
Yaaaaay self care 🌻 

Hope you do great in university and reach inner peace.
Great work so happy for you that you are choosing to make your mental health a priority 😊
Admitting that you have mental health issues and seeking help is one of the biggest hurdles and the fact you did so is a testament to your recovery.  You're a wonderful lady and you're going to have a great time in college.  I bet the people you meet will be absolutely enthralled with you, and they're so lucky to have the privilege of your company
Glad to hear that you’re getting your mind into shape  - all of the mental exercise will pay off. You’ve earned it - so happy for you!
Oh, wow!

You're gonna whip college, no problem, I'm sure of it! Keep that warm smile shining bright, friend!
Way to go. Remember to celebrate even the smallest victories
You have such a cute, infectious smile. It makes everyone who looks at you want to smile. Also, I'm proud of you. Good luck at college.
Thank you!! Inner peace is exactly what I'm aiming for ♡
Thank you ♡ I struggled to accept that I should go back to therapy, but I'm hopeful this was the correct choice ♡
That is so sweet, thank you so much!! I really appreciate your kind words ♡♡
My mind will be super buff once I'm recovered!! Thank you ♡♡
Thank you ♡♡ Will make sure my smile keeps going strong!! ♡
thank you, will do ♡♡
thank you so much..! I'm actually kinda self-conscious about my smile, so this means a lot ♡♡
It's really cute.
That fish you drew is awesome and you’re beautiful. This post also exudes an amazing positivity that makes me really confident you’ll be a successful person no matter what life throws at you.
Not sure what it was but either way just know there are positive thoughts flowing into the universe for you! And if by chance its type 1 diabetes I esp feel for you, my 4 yr old son got diagnosed last year, it's been hard but we are attacking it together everyday! 
  You will get thru and if you ever need more encouragement or to vent just message me! No one has to be alone!
You have such a kind smile and warm eyes. I have no doubt that you will face this hardship and sail right through, because you're strong. So, so strong.
You have such a warm smile - I hope you find the strength you need to make this transition in your life. I know change is intimidating, but you’ve got this.
I'm sorry. I hope it gets easier. I'll support you. Also, I love your look.
Your beard is beyond epic! Keep on fighting the good fight.
That is a great motto to life. I'm happy that you're happy. Also, that beard is epic.
You know it! Head down and keep grinding and it’s finally starting to pay off.
I know self harm can be a hard drug to resist. I offer that I'm always a message away if you feel alone. As a bipolar person I feel your pain and know that the struggle seems daunting but you are strong it's in there. Plus can I say your lovely and rocking those glasses.
Hey sweetie, sorry you're feeling down. Please, please, please don't self harm. It makes me sad to think that you're in so much pain that you have to hurt yourself. 

I want you to know that I love you unconditionally, I think you're special, and you make this world a beautiful place just by being yourself.

I also love your artwork. It really speaks to me.

Sending love, hope, encouragement, and positve thoughts.

Peace.
Wow you sound very similar to what I wrote. All I can say from a fellow bi polar friend is that we just have to take it one day at a time.  You can't change yesterday and have no control over tomorrow. So please enjoy your day!! I am thinking of you. What has happened doesn't control our destiny.
I always find it hard to think of something to say... but I want you to know you are so very worth it, you deserve to be happy and to be loved. I really hope you feel better soon and I just know everything will turn out good for you. You are a beautiful person inside and out and deserve to be happy <3 <3
Just a few reasons why you are awesome: 

1. You are beautiful 

2. The way you held the paper with your glasses shows you are adorably creative

3. You bared your soul for strangers on the internet and reached out for help when you needed it. That shows incredible bravery

4. You are strong. Despite the struggles you've had you are still here fighting 

You deserve love and happiness. The world is a better place with you in it. I wish you a bright, beautiful future where these dark days are the dimmest of memories <3
I got tired of trying to figure out how to hold the paper and not be self conscious of my hands so I just stuck it in my glasses.
You deserve to feel happy and safe and secure, and I’m sorry that you don’t feel that way right now. You don’t deserve the hurt you give yourself, even if you feel like you do. If you want a tree in your garden, the best day to plant it was 20 years ago. The second best day is today. Make today the start of your new streak of days without sh - pick that momentum back up again and break your old record
Genius. 

See? You're a problem solver. I've been in a similar situation, and I know it is tough. And it is going to be tough. But, as we just established, you're a problem solver. 

You're smart and creative in your thought process, so I know you will be able to over come this. Take it a simple day at a time, and before you know it, days stretch into weeks and years. 

You are not alone. You got this.
My grandfather also had Alzheimers. A wise men once told me that it's the quality of time that's important, not the quantity. No matter what, your father still loves you. He will always love you. You are his son. Nothing will ever change that. 

Also, I'm wishing your sister a quick recovery.
I didn’t figure out what I wanted to do with my life until I was almost done with my second degree. Don’t put too much pressure on yourself! Take a variety of classes, it might help you find what you want to do. Whatever it ends up being, enjoy learning new things until you figure it out.

Also, Alzheimer’s sucks, but it doesn’t change how much your dad loves you. He may not remember your name, but there will always be something inside him that knows he loves you.
life is hard but it will make you a better man just stay strong brother !
Life can be a dick sometimes, we know. You just gotta swim through the bullshit, and climb to the top. Conquer life. You can do it bro, we believe in you.
My grandfather sent me a copy of this poem when I was in my early 20's with a short note explaining how it was his favorite poem and helped him, he hoped it would do me the same. I hope this poem helps you the way it continues to help me:   


The Road Not Taken  
By Robert Frost   


Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,   
And sorry I could not travel both  
And be one traveler, long I stood  
And looked down one as far as I could  
To where it bent in the undergrowth;  


Then took the other, as just as fair,   
And having perhaps the better claim,   
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;  
Though as for that the passing there  
Had worn them really about the same,   


And both that morning equally lay  
In leaves no step had trodden black.  
Oh, I kept the first for another day!   
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,   
I doubted if I should ever come back.   


I shall be telling this with a sigh  
Somewhere ages and ages hence:   
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I--   
I took the one less traveled by,   
And that has made all the difference.
Dating is so hard! But keep trying, don’t let this get you down. You are a good looking dude and only 23!
I'm sorry for what your going through, I can only imagine the deception you must be feeling from that message. 

You seem like a great guy in appearance, i'm quite surprise things are not more favorable in the dating area. I hope you meet someone that completes you soon. Take care!
Ugh! Dating apps are the worst; they’re especially hard when you’re young and trying for dates. You deserve to invest in yourself and your interests, love with come naturally when it’s ready. Your hair is gorgeous and your eyebrows are great! Keep being you and the right person will come along.
Haven't had much experience with dating sites but it can be rough. I admire your persistence. You can have all my online hugs. Your smile is really cute and I love your hair btw!
If I was there, I'd give you a hug. Someone someday is going to come around. You don't know yet, but someone is going to think you are the most amazing guy in the world. Just hang in there.
You look like the kind of guy that would take a girl out to watch a sunrise/sunset-a good thing
Aw you’re pretty handsome!
{{{{¥}}}}
You’re handsome and young, you will find your person. Don’t get discouraged!! You have kind eyes and from what I can tell a good soul. (((Hugs)))
Thanks. I don't blame her, she was dealing with a lot of inner turmoil and conflict after meeting the other guy this weekend, since they have certain things in common.
Gurl, what's wrong with either? Mainly the thighs touching, which is completely normal depending on body type!

You can wear whatever you feel comfortable wearing, and you don't even look a day over 30 like please.
You look fucking amazing. Wear whatever you want!
Hi! Local body positive activist here - your body is just fine and awesome the way it is! You deserve to take up space, wear whatever you want, and not be ashamed. Stretch marks are natural and most human beings - thin, mid size, plus size, everyone - have them. Your body is strong and capable of taking you where you want to go, and that’s amazing. You are worthy of respect, love, and being seen no matter your shape or size. You’re crushing it! I’m sure your friends don’t give a single thought to the way your body looks; they just want to have fun and spend time with you.
I think you look great 👍
Yes ma'am you are of course allowed! And you look damn fine in it, I must say. I hope next time you can focus on having fun! You truly look beautiful!
Remember, the world is filled with people and most of them struggle with some sort of perceived imperfection, myself included. You are human and imperfect and lovely 💖
I have those things, too. You look great. Love the suit. Great makeup.
Wear whatever you want with pride! 
Like wow! You are gorgeous at 40!
Rock it, girl!
You aren’t going to getting anyone looking at you in disgust for wearing that out swimming for sure. You are in shape enough to wear that.  I wouldn’t feel self conscious, especially at 40.
You're gorgeous!
Judging by the picture, I thought you were 28. You look really good. You can really rock that bikini. Also, I like the pink hair.
screw the petite friends i would want you!!!! That right there is a real woman!!! wear whatever you want you look incredible in the bikini!!!!
Well my bf likes to tell me ‘thick thighs save lives’ and honestly, unless you told me, I would have never thought you were 40. Literally you look maaaaaybe 30. Also you are absolutely allowed to wear a bikini!! Try on any bathing suit that makes you happy! I’ve had stretch marks all over my body since I was 10 (grew really fast) So trust me when I say this; your lightning stripes are beautiful. It’s like having tattoo’s that your body made for itself. Yeah they aren’t the greatest and you may even regret them but there’s no denying that they’re still art ❤️.
Don’t look 40 to me! I’m 42, and ya know, just like wine, we all get better with age. You got looks, wisdom, and experience...imma bet there were some dudes straight checking you out, you just didn’t know it.
Your eyes are gorgeous. Just a pic of your face alone would display your natural beauty. Stay positive!
You look like you’re 25! 
You’re very pretty :)
You look great from head to toe =)
Totally ogle you at the beach and totally tap that 🤷🏻‍♂️
You look good!

I do empathize with you and actually commend you for going to the beach with your friends! I'm a dude and even though there's less pressure for us with appearances, I still have a hard time enjoying time at the beach if it's going to be surrounded with people who have great bodies.

Like I have no problem going there by myself or with family or whatever, but if I'm the only one with an "unhealthy" body type, I have a hard time.

So not only do you look good, but you have confidence as well! That's great! Keep it up!
You probably wouldn’t get this reference but Kakyoin approves
You look like Tara Reid (back in the day before she destroyed herself with booze and whatnot), especially in the eyes. Which are beautiful btw.
First of all, you look great. Second, wear whatever the hell you want. I’m 51 and you bet your ass I wear whatever, including a bikini if I feel like it. Anyone who says you can’t has issues.
What others think doesn't matter. Unless them bitches paying your bills, you pay those bitches no mind ;) You look fabulous sug!
Honey, if I had your body I would be so proud! I see nothing wrong here. You are beautiful!!
Girl im 42 and i wish my body looked like yours. You r  rocking it. Btw im jealous of your cleavage
You look amazing, and that bikini is SO cute!!! I especially love the pattern on the top!

I'm a 26yo mom with stretch marks and a LOT of pale skin. I feel you.

But here's something I try to tell myself often that the only person who's opinion truly matters is yourself.

You're beautiful!
I think you look awesome!
You're gorgeous!
Beautiful skin and body. It's so easy for us to be hard on ourselves. I think you look great
:( makes me sad to see someone gorgeous feeling insecure. Plenty of bikini years left in you girl x
 HI There! Sorry I"m a little late in finding this post. Would you still like 1 from me? Thanks! :)  My gosh, you look great! I dunno what those people are talking about. Dang!
Wear that bikini with pride.
You look fantastic
I agree, she looks much younger than 40!!
Thank you! ❤
Thigh gaps are overrated and stretch marks don’t matter. I think you look great.
Thanks! Needed to hear that today ❤
Thank you! I guess you're right about my friends. It's just that I always felt BIG compared to them. Thanks for your words, they ment a great real today! ❤
Thank you! 😊
Thank you! And I know, you're right, one shouldn't compare body types or anything for that matter. Thanks for the reminder! ❤
Thank you! In that case, you have great thighs too! ;) ❤
Thanks! Today I really needed to hear that! ❤
Thank you! I think I will! 😊
Thank you! ❤
Thanks! You have no idea how good it feels to hear that after today! ❤
Thank you! 😊 28... hah! I have a 17 year old son :-P But your comment made me happy! Thanks! ❤
Thanks! 😊 I feel like an amazon next to my petite friends. I'm 5'8" and, well,  big built :-P
Thanks for your kind words! ❤ perhaps I should wear my stretch marks with more pride. They are a sign I carried two babies after all. 😊
Thank you! 😊❤
Mostly I feel it too 😊
There’s nothing wrong with being big or small or tall or short compared to anyone else! I totally understand the comparison and feeling inadequate in a society that says “thin=beautiful=worthy.” Their bodies are great and so is yours :)  Your body is yours alone, and it’s the only one you get. You deserve to love it and show it off however you’re comfortable. You don’t have to be small to be beautiful, worthy, seen, etc. I hope the rest of your day and week are fantastic!
You’re most welcome ❤️ Enjoy the summer!
perfect high and perfect build. You my dear look incredible!!! rock the bikini
Two kids, 40 years old, and you still look that good in a bikini?! Honey I pray I look like you one day. You’re aging like wine.
And yours too!! Thanks again! 😭❤
Thanks! 😘
Hey, the whole sub is about attention and validation! It's okay to need support and love in your life; we're all here to help give it to you :) You don't deserve to be yelled at or berated. You're allowed to be whoever you are and to do what's best for yourself. Some day you will get out of this situation and be surrounded by nothing but those who support you and hope the best for you.

Even in tears, your eyeliner is super sharp and your eyebrows are on point. That's a skill! Your haircut frames your face very well and it's a super cute color!

And if it'll help, the community over at r/raisedbynarcissists is awesome for people with overbearing and difficult parents; we're always happy to listen and support on that sub, too.
I think we all like attention. Some people just don't admit it lol. Sorry your mom yells at you a lot. That sucks, but hopefully you don't have to live with her much longer. You're super cute! :) i like your bangs!
Oh sweetie, I'm so sorry you have to suffer like this. You don't deserve to be treated this way.

No matter what I love you unconditionally, you are beautiful, and you make this world a better place just by being yourself, no matter what your mom might think.

Sending love, encouragement, hope, and positive thoughts.

Peace.

Also, I saw on your profile you like classical. Here's an animation set to La Damnation de Faust https://youtu.be/SL6-gTwuV8s
I'm not sure how old you are but I was raised by a pretty horrible mom that gaslighted me and treated me like shit my entire life. She told me I'd never be able to do anything and I got a kick-ass degree and will "hopefully" have a kick-ass job soon. You can and will get away soon, and your life will become your own. You'll be able to look back on this and the pain will only be a very faint memory. It hurts now, and it's horrible you're experiencing it, but you will come out the other side. I spent time at friend's houses a lot, and as soon as I was 18 I was fucking out the door faster than you could imagine. Even when she threatened to kill herself if I left, I still walked out - and she's still alive. Don't let your mother's bitterness take you down with her. They know the right buttons to push and its painful and shitty and horrible, but I promise you, you will be able to take control one day. And when you do, you'll be unstoppable.
We need to take away the stigma of the phrase "attention seeker" many people do it for the wrong reasons, but then there's the one like you who just want a smiling face to make sure they're alright. Well know that I see you and I acknowledge your pain and rest assured I'm sending as much positivity and love as I can muster to help you shine bright like the star you are 😁❤️
I am a mom. Feel free to use my words as mom instead of hers.

I'm proud of you. It takes a lot of courage to speak up and speak out about your mental health. It takes a lot of strength to survive in a household where you constantly feel cut down. You are worth love and kindness. Keep fighting for yourself. Stay strong. Make me proud by being there best version of yourself that you can be. It's ok to have bad days, just do your best to stand back up and move forward when they're over.
I really want to give you a hug right now. I hope you can be somewhere where you are appreciated. I hope you can be happy. If you need anything, I'll be here. 

Also, I really like your hair. It's cute.
You look like you could be a rockstar that eventually leaves the industry due to corrupt agents/managers and becomes an independent artist that loses popularity yet maintains a loyal fan base because the music is just so good.
I wish I could wing my eye liner that well! You’re beautiful. I hope everyone’s encouragement helps.
Hey there. Chin up! You’ve got a lot going for yourself. You’re young, beautiful and smart.
I'm sorry about the way you're treated by your mom. Always remember you deserve better than that and will live a full and happy life. You are stronger than you know.
Hugs. Sometimes we are at are darkest before arr best moments. Yours will come just have to wait but it will be worth it.
Oh snap I love your eye makeup!!
It takes strength to even repost I’m sure although through negativity your heart is growing stronger so when it comes to love you will be able to love much stronger than any metal there is
Honestly my mother yelled "What's wrong with you?" at me so many times when I was younger. It was difficult, but I eventually moved past consistently thinking something is wrong with me. I know it's rough, but it gets better. Stay strong.
Needing some positive feedback doesn’t make you an attention seeker, it just means you know you deserve better than you’re getting. Hold on to that knowledge, and when you find someone who treats you the way you deserve, you’ll feel it. Just make sure that you treat yourself right, too!
Your hair is perfectly matched to your features, which are absolutely stunning!

I'm sorry you're caught up in an unpleasant home life... You look strong. You are the super hero in your own life. I believe you can make it through this!
The way a person treats you is a reflection of THEM, not you! 

You deserve love and happiness and your mother being a bitch is not your fault. Hang in there! Sending you virtual hugs if you want them!
Of course you seek (positive) attention. You need it like medicine. I don't know what your mothers problem is, but she seems toxic. I'm glad you reach out to us for help. You give us a chance to help you and that is a valuable gift to give us.

Looking at your profile shows me that you are a bright young woman but it looks like you have some rough years ahead of you. Take all the help you can get and you will muster through.

As children we are very loyal to our parents but you are old enough to see that your loyalty ~~should~~ must be to yourself first. Don't be afraid to consider talking to the CPS about what's going on.
I don't think cry face suits you, I know it's a cliche but too pretty for cry face. All I can say is once youre past it, you'll realise how short it was. I hope something great comes along and provides indestructible smile face.

10/10 would save if in distress.
That winged liner tho!! 😍😍😍
Thank you. This made me cry more, but they were more happy tears than sad :)
I have to live with my parents for two more years, and then I start college. Thank you :)
I have no idea what that piece is or what it’s about, but it did help me calm down and stop crying, so thank you :)
I’d have to have a good voice for that. I used to think I had an okay voice, but my mom says I really don’t so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
My mom used to yell at me about how much of a disappointment, now she just says how shitty I am and how sick of my attitude she is.
Hey, crying is good! Let yourself feel whatever you're feeling. I hope the rest of your day is a little lighter :)
Best of luck to you 💖
To be honest, she can shove it, in my opinion. You're not obligated to impress your mother or have the sort of attitude she likes.
can i just say, your toasting lifted *my* mood. you really are a snack that smiles back 😁
You're really pretty. Your eyes are just absolutely beautiful. 

Also, congrats on the degree. I'm sorry about the interview. I hope you find your dream job soon. Something that meets and exceeds your expectations.
Job hunting sucks ass and is super draining, but you worked damn hard for that degree. Someone will definitely recognize that and offer you a great job.
"you can walk straight through hell with a smile" - you got this!!!
Don't count yourself out! You got a whole entire degree and deserve to be proud of yourself. The job hunt is hard, but you can do hard things. You're smart and capable. There will be more applications and more interviews and more opportunities. Doors will open for you soon. Be kind to yourself while you wait for them to.

And on a lighter note, you have such striking eyes, gorgeous hair, and a lovely bone structure. Your skin is beautiful & I will buy whatever your routine is tbh.
Don't let yourself get down over a single interview...hell, even over a couple dozen interviews. Just be persistent and stay positive. I guarantee you'll find a nice job.  
Edit: Thought of something else I wanted to say. First off, they stood you up on an interview?? To hell with that company, that's a huge red flag. Second, it wasn't a complete waste for you either; you spent time preparing, and that's time well spent.
Thank you! <3 I know I'll get there soon. I'm just very drained from the process.
Pffffft. I'm super flattered that you actually think I have a routine. xD If I could bottle "roll out of bed like idgaf" I wouldn't need a job!
Girl I would buy it!
Lovely smile, beautiful eyes. Their loss. Save your heart for someone who will treasure it.
Keep on smiling, it suits you 😊
You'll find somebody someday! You're worth it!
You look like a wonderful, sweet, kind, beautiful person so whoever broke your heart doesn't deserve someone like you and you deserve all you want in life and more
 Even your forced smile is beautiful; I hope the world will get to see the real thing from you soon. 

That really sucks, but the right person for you is going to come along when it’s time; since this clearly wasn’t it, that means someone even better is coming, which also means you just dodged a bullet without even realizing it. Take heart, friend—this is the lead-up to things getting much better for you, and I can’t wait to see what is in store for you.
You have a super cute button nose. Heart break is a horrible thing. It hurts less over time.
You're adorable!
Heartbreak is hard to beat, but it helps you grow and be strong. You'll find the right person in time. Be your best self each day, and good times will come your way. Stay positive ♥️
So sorry this happened to you, but it’ll turn out to be for the best! You’re objectively gorgeous and I’m sure you’ll be back on your feet soon!
You should smile more cuz you have a very cute one
You’re a cutie! And a broken heart is awful, but I just feel you will find someone else that’s even better, and loves you back a 100%.

I know, seems far away now, but I still wanted to say it.

Keep on smiling as you look great doing so, and you will surely mend that heart :)
You have a cute smile and a super cute nose! I hope you start to heal and find someone who loves you for you unconditionally:) have a good week :)
You are cute as a button: nice eyes, good symmetrical features, nice smile. Very pretty, whoever broke your heart was a chump.
Well you are gorgeous plenty of opportunities when you are ready 👍
You are beautiful and even your forced smile looks lovely so your real smile must look even lovelier! 

I had my heart broken badly last year, and it was horrible. I know that everyone will tell you that you’ll feel better with time, and that it’s probably the last thing you want to hear, but it’s true. In the early days I found that distracting myself helped the most - I watched a lot of Netflix in bed cuddling teddies. 

When you feel up to it, spending time with friends and family really helps take your mind off it - making new, happy memories with people who love you helps your heart to remember that life is still beautiful, vibrant and so full of love, even if it doesn’t always seem it. 

Sorry if any of that sounds patronising/really obvious - I think it’s what I would have wanted somebody to say to me this time last year when I had my heart broken so I hope it helps you, even just a little bit. I have every faith that you will get through this and come out happier and stronger on the other side!
If he/she broke your heart, they aren't the one for you. You're beautiful and I know your smile will get easier as time passes.
Heartbreak happens to the best of us, but now you have the opportunity to truly invest in and fall in love with yourself. You deserve it! Best of luck as you go through this
You have a cute smile
You have a beautiful smile and I think it would be even more pretty if it was truly genuine. I hope in the future you’ll bless the world with it. :))
Someone's going to think you're absolutely adorable, with beautiful eyes and a pretty smile, and an amazing personality. Actually, I think that, and I think most of the world thinks that. You're going to find someone. I know it. And in the meantime, know that you are a strong, independent person who only wants the best for herself. Because she only deserves the best.
You adore Adore Delano?? Such good taste in drag queens! (Adore is so iconic)
Heartbreak sucks, but with a smile like that, someone is sure to come along and put it back together. Keep smiling!
But when you do smile...it’s beautiful...do more of that.
I would kill for your perfect little nose!!
Ehhh I was a big fan when I made that account, but she’s been kind of a brat lately, so I’m sticking with my eternal fav Phi Phi, and the new Dragula cast as my faves
Honestly my nose has always been my biggest insecurity so everyone complimenting it is just hitting the right spot😭😭
No way, I'm super jealous! I've built up a "nose job" fund several times to get a look similar to yours lol. But I think we all want what we don't have, right?
I’ve just always thought it’s too big for my face
That sounds really tough and frustrating. But jobs change and so do dreams and new opportunities always arise, so all is not lost. And you have pretty eyes and great coloring and a fantastic sense of style!
You'll get there someday! Also I love your hair.
All I can say is Hang in there, friend. You can make it through this.
Your enthusiasm for that which you enjoy is truly a marvel. I cannot understate how palpable your passion for things is; I think that's super fucking cool.

Oh also, I really dig your style. :)
You will beat this. Your life will improve. You dont know me but remember me because one day you'll realize I was right. You can change, you can grow, you can thrive.
I lost my shot at a dream job too just the other day, it hurts. It's even worse when you're not all that happy at your current job. Definitely don't feel bad that you gave up the better paying one. You know what you need, so feel confident in that and don't let yourself regret it for a second. This setback is only temporary. Even if you don't ever get that dream job, a new dream may one day inspire you, indeed it probably will, life it just kinda like that. You can fulfill this dream too though if you keep at it, and the wait will only make it more meaningful, not less.

In other news, those glasses really suit you, as does that hair color and style with the way it frames your face. You've a good fashion sense, you look pretty classy, especially the necklace.
Your style is iconic! You'll find a career path that suits you with time and patience. For now, you're totally allowed to be upset and stressed over it -- do what you can to add some more self care and stress relief in the mean time :)
You remind me of Lydia from Beetlejuice! Always a good thing!
Hey, I find it super admirable that you'd stay true to yourself, turning down that supposedly desirable position when it didn't really resonate with your passions! I believe it takes some balls to do something like that and I applaud you for it.

That being said, I'm really sorry you didn't get your dream job. You surely would have deserved it but it just didn't happen yet, not this time. However, I'm positive there will definitely come more opportunities for you to express and apply yourself on that path you desire to travel, 100%!You don't sound like the kind of person to me who would give in and stop trying, even if you are feeling stressed and discouraged now. It's okay to feel down, but remember how far you have already gotten, and how close you already were - take that as a positive. And then when you are ready to give another go, do it, as bravely as you did now. Take this as an opportunity to learn, and remember that everyone gets turned down sometimes, even the greatest of the greatest. You've got this!

Also, I love your style. I find it quite fascinating! The necklace is amazing.
Aw, I'm really sorry. It can't be easy, I can relate as I'm in a rough job myself and could use something better. I sincerely think this will pass for you, and judging by your clothes and appearance, you'll still have a great sense of style after it does too. Good luck out there and be good to yourself. <3
It's always good to count the things that you are happy with in your life. I count my self very unlucky with relationships but when I go into work everybody is kind to me. When I read what you posted I realized that everyone has ups and downs in their lives.
Fair play if you ambitious a few kmockbacls are to be expected, and fair play waiting for something right for you. It may not be the easier path but it's  the most courageous.
Thank you so so much!!
I'm feeling so down declining a job that could make my financial burdens lessen...but I guess I think of it as *if I'm going to be looking for better, I should be doing such while I'm happy and comfortable, which I am in my current position*


Thank you for your words. 💕💕
Thank you so much!!!

I'm praying someday soon haha
Iconic? 🥰💕 oh my heavens thank you so so much!!

I'm hoping and praying!!
Best compliment ever!!!🥰🥰🥰🥰
I'm tearing up at work now for a totally different reason!!😭🥰🥰🥰
Your words are so kind and wonderful I could embroider them on my pillow!

I'm going to keep trying!!
Haha thanks! I've been called many things , but courageous has never been one of them.
I'm hoping my future is as bright as I wish it to be!
Not having enough money is always stressful. But if you can get by as you are for a while then you’re in a strong position. Hang in there! 💪♥️
You're welcome!
Yes your matte black glasses are so cute and that choker is awesome! Clearly you have passion and a vibrant sense of self; you'll be just fine :)
Exactly. I'm working a full regular salary job and then a small part time job after work 3 times a week. It's a little extra, but I'm thankful
As long as you have space and time to be your excellent self, all is well.
You should be very proud of yourself for being such a strong, ambitious person.  A job isn't worth destroying your mental health over, irregardless of the compensation.  Even though you were passed over for your dream job, I believe in you and I know with determination you'll get there eventually.
Your hair looks magically soft.
Your 5 o’clock shadow is doing a lot for you! Really brings out your handsomeness.
OP you look cute!
Btw sorry for the bad pic my phone isn’t that good so the writing isn’t that clear
You can only do so much and there will be someone who would appreciate what you’ve done more than she did. Dont ever change keep being that great dude to everyone
You're doing the right thing, man. Nobody you should be with should lead you on according to their whims. While it's understandable that you feel guilty, remember that her problems aren't your doing, and aren't your obligation. You tried to help her and she treated you with disrespect. Time to move on. Stay strong, stay positive, and know that you made the right decision. We're here for ya. ✊
Hey there! You are a good looking person and I'm sure you'll have no problems finding other amazing women (when you're ready to look again). And when you do feel up to it again, just remember that you can't be anyone else's salvation just like no one else can be that for you. Take care of yourself!
You look like the kind of guy that butterflies would trust and sit on your hand
You seem, like a great guy. You'll surely find someone better soon.
A very handsome man. You should not feel bad, I’m sure many other girls/guys/whatever like you. This one girl shouldn’t slow you down, keep on pedaling!
I’m so sorry this happened ): I know you’ll find someone who will treat you right and love you unconditionally! Keep your chin up! You’re a handsome guy and you’ll find someone that fits you even better! I hope you have a great day 😊
I’ve gone through the same scenario my friend. If there is someone like that that you chase for so long and they only end up wanting you when you aren’t around, it’s toxic. You deserve much better and you will find better. Hang in there my guy
It's easy to blame yourself in situations like this, but truth be told, she probably wasn't open to help. Hopefully now this is a wake up call for her to get the help she needs. I'm sure you did all that you could, and you're looking good today too!
Focus on yourself man, you're gonna be okay cuz if you had the time to chase that kind of girl, you surely will find the time to focus on yourself and be open to more positive changes.
I'm sorry about that. I'm supporting you. I know you can definitely find someone else if you want to. If not, you are a handsome, likeable guy that deserves to be happy.
You deserve better than to let her make her issues your problem. A true soulmate will reciprocate and will put in as much effort as you. You obviously are a very loving and caring person, and your soulmate will see that, too.
Hey homeboy! Stay strong and don’t get sucked into negativity. Don’t beat yourself up about the girl, focus on moving forward and progressing in life
You are adorable with great hair. You will find a girl who is everything she was and more who appreciates you for you and not just how you feed her ego. Also you are young and you can do anything!!
What’s that?
Light beard stubble
Ahh gotcha thanks!
First day jitters are normal! You've got this. You made it this far, nowhere to go but up!
Easy, just don't overthink things. Be calm.
Congratulations!
It'll take some time to adjust to the new gig and find your stride but the good news is that your new employer knows that too. Just hit the ground running and everything will be fine.

I wish you the best of luck and hope that this turns out to be the start of a great thing for you.
Knock it out of the park!
You have lovely kind eyes, any new job is lucky to have you. I noticed your paw print tattoo - I have one too! All the paws that walked through your life will keep you safe on your first day.
First day scares are normal. Think positive and you’ll fucken nail it! (Self pep talk- scream it!)
You got this 💪🏻 you applied because you know your qualified so now go show them your over qualified by doing the best you can!
You look powerfull and incontrol! Dont be scared look what you can do and do it. Give it your best and you will be welcome on the long run. Dont be discouraged by smal knockbacks and most importandly have fun!
Congratulations!!
So what's the new job....

Visualise what you have to do and see yourself achieving it.... Good luck
Hey. If you can handle tattoos, especially big ones, you can handle anything. 😃 Stay cool, stay confident, and kick ass!
You got this! They hired you because they believe in you. You'll do great!
You're going to do amazing on this first day of your job. I know it's not ideal to feel nervous on your first day, but it's understandable. It's like being nervous for a first day of school, etc. It's similar, anyway. I'm not sure how intense it is for you, but I think you're going to do great. I hope that you enjoy your new job, too.

I'm happy to hear you have a new job, too. Sometimes it's what we need. I'm hoping it will be a positive thing for you. I had an interview for a new job myself yesterday. So I understand the nervousness of it. I think change can sometimes be a good thing. I hope it will be for you.

Cheers to you for going forward and being brave and going to your new job. :)
Congrats on the new gig! You will do great things. Have an amazing day!!
Things are never as bad as you think they are/will be. You got this!
First off, you are going to do great! Don't be afraid to ask questions, but I'm sure that you will rock this job. 

Secondly, you are gorgeous, and I thought you should know
You got this.  You’re gonna be great.  I started a new job in September of 18.  Even with 15 years of experience in my field - I still had jitters, my first day.   It ended up being the best professional decision I’ve ever made. Good luck to you.  Your gonna kill it.
It's always nerve wracking to start a new job, but you got the job! That's half the battle. You are the person they want and you'll do great! Your hair is super cute too. ❤️❤️ I hope you have a good day!
Oh wow, you look awesome. Neat tattoos from what I can tell, and those buns for your hair are adorable as hell, you also have lovely eyes!

&#x200B;

Good luck in your new job, I know you'll rock it.
Everyone's nervous on the first day, you'll be alright.

Also, not relevant but your hair is awesome!
**CONGRADULATIONS & GOOD LUCK!**
That's normal! Just think to yourself "I've got this" and maintain a positive attitude.  I'm sure you'll do great!
The first day of anything always makes me nervous, whether it be school or work or going to a social meet-up.

You'll do great! It will take time to adjust but you will, I promise. Keep your head up and everything will be okay.

Good luck!
You are beautiful, powerful and ready! You have to believe yourself first for others to see that you are ready. I wish you luck!
Good luck. Also, love the 2 buns, they're really cute. And your eyes are gorgeous. Ok, you're just really cute. 

I hope your new job is everything you expected and more. I hope everyone there is really nice, and that the work is fulfilling. I hope you make friends there.
You got this...no worries! Do your best, and that’s what you do.
8h later

How’d it go?
Don’t get fired!
Your hair is so cute and I wish I could do mine like that. Also, I hope your first day went great :)
I'm having first day job jitters too! Let's show them who's boss yeah? We got this!

You're gorgeous too! Which is just a bonus! You're going to rock this new job!
You've got nothing to worry about.  Rest easy.  Get a good night's sleep.  Put your head on your pillow tonight with a smile on your face!  You got this!
Every single person that has ever had a job at some point it was their first day as well. You got this.
Fuckin hell girl. You got this 100%. Heading for promotion already and haven't even started. You look strong and smart, the killer combo. People won't know whether to fear you or fancy you, either way best stay in your good books.
You look nice! Good luck!  :)
As a manager, unless you had a ton of experience at the position you were hired for, I would be concerned if you weren't a little nervous.

It's normal to feel that way - it means you're taking it seriously.
I'm also a writer with anxiety and PTSD! Keep trying to focus on the positive and do what you can to take care of yourself. You'll get through this with time. I know the mental stuff magnifies everything and makes it harder, but know that you're not alone in dealing with it and things will pan out for the better :)
Congrats on the house it's one of the most important parts of your life, and where you'll make a lot more memories so congrats on that! Also if you don't have many friends try talking to your bfs friends it can help a lot! Have a good rest  of your week! :)
Congrats on the new house. And I bet the 2 of you are adorable together. Also, you have the prettiest eyes, and a really nice beard. 

The retail job is just one step of the way to your dreams. It sucks that you got rejected, but don't ever give up. You'll get the dream job one day. 

Here's an internet hug. Everything's going to be fine. I'm also a gay writer with ptsd and anxiety. I am totally willing to listen and offer support.
Yo man. Don’t think too much about the employment. The right job will come along in time.
Your boyfriend and you just took a huge life step in moving in together. Be positive and focus on the great things going on
Your hair is a glorious mess. I mean it looks stylishly messy. It's an impressive mess! It reminds me of a Meg Ryan from When Harry Met Sally. You'd be a great 90s romcom heroine.
If you didn’t get this job then another, better one is waiting for you. No matter how bleak things get, there is always a reason for it and because of that, you’re always exactly where you’re supposed to be in life. As long as you’re being yourself and doing your best, then you’ll always be perfect because you’re exactly who you’re supposed to be.
It's always difficult to go through a trying time in your life and I am sorry to see that you are physically and mentally unwell. Regardless of your state in life, you are incredibly valuable as a human being. No matter what problems you are having, no matter what trials you are going through, you are valuable. It may be hard to see your own value in your valley of trials, but know that you are worth so much more than you can ever know. You have been so strong to carry yourself with all of your burdens, let me encourage you to endure and grow stronger. You are doing a great job. You deserve to feel confident in who you are as a valuable human being. You are a beautiful woman with vibrant eyes,  amazing style, and incredible hair. Keep being your amazing self. I hope you have a wonderful day :)
Stay positive! I got turned down for a job at Ace Hardware AND a job at Amazon (Seriously?) But now I've got one at FedEx making 15 an hour. More options at other companies too! Good work will come your way. Just keep your chin up and keep looking. 😁
It's okay to be sad and overwhelmed; this is a lot to deal with for one person! Take care of yourself and know that things will pass with time and patience.
You look like you can make a playlist for every mood
I really want to give you a hug right now. I hope it gets easier. I hope you feel better, both physically and mentally.
Hey there, give it time.

You're young and there's no rush. Just breathe and take a moment for yourself. There's plenty of jobs out there and you'll find one soon enough.  You're kind but willful as well and you don't need any advice from me aside from a simple reminder to be patient and work on one thing at a time.

&#x200B;

Hang in there. You're not alone. You've got this.
I hope you recover soon! 
Jobs come and jobs go, maybe an even better one will pop up and you discover it was meant to be.
Just keep aiming for whatever you want to do and love, and you’ll be fine!
And continue looking gorgeous while you’re at it, ‘cause you’re super pretty :)
I'm 100% sure you will find another job, you look like someone trustful idk why. Also everyone gets a health problem in his life, you will find a way out :)

You hair looks amazing, beautiful eyes and those glasses are super cuuuute.
Atleast you look cute af! The rest will sort itself out given time.
It may seem tough to not get the job you interviewed for but you got to see it as they did you a favor by not giving you a job who wouldn’t appreciate your effort and experience!!! Don’t let that bring you down when you know your qualified
Are you Emma Stone’s sister? :) You’re beautiful!
On the plus side, you're beautiful, have a very sweet smile, and kind eyes. I'm sure that missing this job just means a better opportunity in the future. Best of luck!
I'm in the same boat on all counts, sometimes I don't know how I manage to stay positive. Just know you're not alone, dear. It can be super stressful when you have health expenses and it feels like you can't get the job you need. I try to convince myself that it takes some courage, facing health issues while also job hunting, but I sometimes struggle to believe it, and think I'm doing nothing worth commending. But seeing you face that struggle, I can see the courage in you. It certainly inspires confidence in me. I hope knowing that you're not alone and that others see you as rather brave can inspire confidence in you too!

Also, my goodness, those eyes are a lovely color. They look teal, I've only once or twice seen quite a lovely blue-green in someones eyes like that.
girl your shitting on these bitches don't let the world bring you down
All I’ve ever wanted to be was a 90s romcom heroine. :)
This is what I’ve been trying to teach myself! It’s so difficult to break my normal way of thinking of what “could” be and what “should” be. Thank you.
How did u know.
Thank you friend.
Thank you. You are absolutely right.
Yea I’m Gemma Pebble.
Well you look like you are living it! Hell with a bit of editing and placement your pic could be on the front of a VHS in Blockbuster alongside a leading man sporting a goofy expression.
Just do it. Don't overthink it. We all go through these. Me included 👍😉
Better than 90s romcom heroin....... .*heroin*
That's why we both spelt it heroine.
I know
 I was kidding around
I'll be honest you look lovely as hell and your jaw doesn't really look swollen. I bet your picture is gonna be fine as fuck.
Even with a swollen jaw, you still have a beautiful smile :)
Well i dont see anything but beauty, i bet your picture looks awesome!
I had a black eye my senior photo - it became a funny story, your swollen jaw will too. Not great pictures are a school right of passage! You are stunningly beautiful right now and you have your whole life ahead of you, look forward to your bright future.
I’d never know you’d just had surgery if you hadn’t said so; don’t worry at all about your picture.

I was in a similar boat when I got my wisdom teeth out, except I also was allergic to the drug they use to induce clotting afterwards, so I ended up bleeding so badly for so long that I nearly ended up in the ER—they ran out of gauze to pad it with, so I was just sitting there and spitting blood into a trash can. On the bright side, the fact that I made it through without any long-term problems means that as long as you follow their directions to prevent infections or anything, you’ll be fine in no time!
Swollen or not, you're still really pretty! Stay cool, keep it positive and things will work out fine. Have an awesome day 😁
When I had my wisdom teeth out, I had to be completely awake, laughing gas wasn't even an option due to an issue some of my family has, so I know exactly what that's like. I hope you can get past the pain and memories, it does get better, and you look gorgeous for your pictures!
I honestly can't really see anything wrong with your jaw.
You look great!
The swollen jaw isn't as noticeable as you think, I wouldn't have known if you didn't tell me. You look nice, have a nice smile, and your senior picture is going to turn out great, especially if you look this nice in an off the cuff verification picture for Reddit.
You now have an epic story to tell-probably could write a horror story about the wisdom teeth. I’ll buy that book!
I would have never noticed that your jaw was swollen. You're beautiful.
Swollen jaw didn’t make you less pretty. You have a nice smile and pretty eyes. Having had multiple oral surgeries myself, I’m certain you feel far worse than you look!
The combo of your awesome u/ and your great message makes me happy, thank you!
So happy for you. I'm glad lifes going well and you can tell by that wonderful, genuine smile you have on your face. You look happy and beautiful and the world is yours to take, keep at it. Xx
Looking good! Stay positive and the good times will keep on coming. You're doing great!
Congratulations :) That’s really a great feeling, and it’s good you take a second to appreciate it!
And don’t worry, you don’t look super tired, to me at least.
In fact, I think you have very beautiful eyes!
If this is you super tired then I'm already jealous!

You're gorgeous and apply makeup better than I ever will! 

I'm glad things are going great! You earned it!
That’s awesome pretty lady. Staying positive even during my worst moments help me power through them.
Everyone deserves to feel good! Thank you for sharing your happy with us, your smile and sweet eyeliner made me happy too.
ugogurl
I'm happy for you! I hope it keeps going well.
You really pull off those glasses! 

I promise that you will find people in your life who will be there for you no matter what you go through. You are worthy of love from people but you should learn to love yourself first and and see yourself for the wonderful person that you are.

Things will get better☺️
You have such lovely hair. 

One thing I’ve learned is that so many friends come and go, so many people are in your life for a short but important time, because life drags you off in different directions, it’s usually no one’s fault, it’s just the way it goes. When you get ones that stay it’s magical, but you can still gain so much from the ones that leave - sometimes it’s wonderful memories, other times it’s valuable lessons. You will find other people that bring you joy and support.
You're getting things done *and* looking that good?  You have a lot to be proud of!  Not to mention that your hair, nails, and makeup game are on point.  Love your style too.  Keep keeping on and good people will be as attracted to you as everyone in this thread (including me) already is.
[removed]
If friends aren’t there for you then they aren’t real friends at all. Don’t blame yourself for someone sometimes finding real friends is hard. Every life is worth so much don’t value yourself by the number of friends
Ok, my go-to compliment is to think of a celebrity that someone looks like, but this one might be a little esoteric.  


There's this lady who works at my public library. I guess most people wouldn't find her conventionally attractive, but she's pretty to me. She has a heart of gold, and has nothing but kindness for everyone she meets. Even irate library goers who yell and have to be thrown out she feels no animosity towards. She hosts this free class to help people with learning disabilities learn how to use a computer. She's easily one of the best people I've ever met.  


Anyway, you remind me of her, and I couldn't think of anyone in the world better to compare you to.
You achieve, build, grow, develop, and change the world. You make yourself and life around you better every day. People are lucky to know you. You are delightful. To you and all that you were, all that you are, and all that you are yet to be... PROST!
Don’t know why your friends leave you. You’re pretty cute in those glasses! :)
I really like your style. You are quite beautiful and you've found a look that works for you.


I'm so sorry that you're going through hard times and I'm always here if you just need to vent.
Your lips are such a beautiful shape! I love your hair colour also! Friends that use you and leave were never friends, I know it hurts petal but you’re better off without them! You’ve got this! X
Awe you look awesome and like a very good person. Hope you find some better people to have in your life. You deserve it.
Hey! I could use a friend for games, I play words with friends with another girl I know daily and it’s a blast. You deserve the best! If they leave it just means that they hit their expiration date, and nobody wants things past expiration lol. You’re too cute to let them get you down.
Dude... Your skin is PERFECT.  I'm super jealous.
First of all, you're more than enough. You're really, really pretty, you're clearly productive and willing to work hard and pull your weight. You're a gem! 

All you need to do is stop letting other people define you and stand on your own. You're plenty strong enough. It will be scary at first, but you CAN cast off those fake friends, you can make real ones who will love and value you the way you deserve. 

Try to stay positive, keep working hard, and look to yourself for confidence first! You are the best friend you can ever have. You can appreciate your hard work, love the way you look, treat yourself right, and make your life better to live. The good friends will come along in time. Stay strong, stay positive. You can do this 💪 We all care about you and we believe in you!
love the hair. try to find something you love to do and  I'm sure everything will fall into place.
I hope you find friends who admire you for the great person you are,  just take deep breaths and know you got this!
If friends only used you so far they're not real and I bet someday you'll find some people that make you as happy as you make other happy. Keep on searching cause they are out there somewhere. And honestly you're definitely not worthless I  any way, everyone worth something even if it hasn't shown or hasn't been appreciated yet so keep on going gurl cause you deserve that big ass happiness that's definitely gonna come your way
Do you have any hobbies? Maybe joining a sport/activity you enjoy doing and acquiring new skills could help improve your self-worth. It could also be a good way to meet new friends with similar interests!
You ain't alone in this kind of shit sadly, a lot of  us in these particular sorts of sub reddits feel overwhelmed, lost, abandoned by people. Don't give in though, believe me I just broke a three year cycle of my own that was abusing the shit out of me, especially in the last 6-8 months. You gotta gut it out, go balls out and make your own path. I destroyed my own cage, the cage I built. It's scary to have to break free of comfort, but I promise you, everything you do, every day, it's noticed by someone. A smile, a small hello, even something as silly as a high five. Create your own happiness, do things that make you feel good. Stop trying to feel good only because of others. Everyone here will carry you when you can't walk, we'll push you when your stagnant, but you need the will to move on your own. Build your fire, stoke your fire and then set that bitch free, let is torch the cage, let it raze the land, and the golden things still left standing, those are what matter.
You’re gorgeous! But beyond that, I hope you can find some quality friends. Apps like Bumble can help, and even social media pages for hobbies or local places you’re a fan of can be a good start. You deserve to have someone in your life you can trust, and that person is looking for you right now as well.
You’re better than the people you surround yourself with.

The people that you think are your “friends” clearly aren’t deserving of your friendship.

You’re worth more than you know, and anyone who doesn’t agree with that, isn’t worth a minute of your time.
I love your look, you seem like a beautiful person, both inside and out. Life is tough, and it's full of learning experiences and stepping stones. I know, I'm in the middle of a bunch of learning experiences now. Please just know that you have value, the people who love you truly do love you, and this too shall pass. If you need to message anyone and talk, whether it be about issues or just about your day, please feel free to send me a message!
People aren't worth your time. Believe me even the oldest of friends tend to bite like snakes once humanity fades away.
Don't be too hard on yourself this time will pass and its better having no friends that only use you.
I'm sure you'll find good friends who love you for who you are.
Nonetheless you always have a friend here and all my friends are your friends too so don't feel too sad or alone ❤
Be happy and lead a happy life Friend. We all love you no matter what and will always love you no matter what ❤
You can message or talk to me in comments if you want a friend
I'm sure that there is someone who cares, and knows you're a lovely woman, you may not see it yourself, but others know.
It sounds like your "friends" are the worthless ones. If they don't value you, they're not worth anything. You are more precious (and beautiful) than you know. Don't let others define your value. You are not worthless. You're priceless.
Good gracious, you look so beautiful. If you were in front of me I would have kissed your forehead. People will use you for their purpose don't let that thing get you. You a beautiful person, just keep doing good and do not expect anything from anyone. Love your hairstyle.
It sucks that you're going through a rough time, but always remember to be kind to yourself and to love yourself. You are enough. You are not worthless. Just because some dumbasses out there don't realize that, doesn't mean you should give up on people or yourself.
This is me. Hopefully we can learn to be positive soon. One thing I’ve been trying to do is find at least one good thing in the day. Even something very small. Anyways. You’re so pretty and I’m jelly of your hair. I miss my long hair and yours is so pretty and healthy looking.
You ain’t worthless
Your hairstyle and glasses really compliment your bone structure!
Your lips are like the perfect size. Perfect
I think you are gorgeous, I'm so proud of you for doing the chores! If you feel a panic attack coming stop and redirect yourself -- what are 2 things I see, what are two things I can touch, what are 2 things I smell, what are 2 things I can hear...sometimes its enough to redirect my mind.
You probably have a pretty nice smile
You've got beautiful skin and lips.
Self worth is something that you need to work for and it’s not something that develops immediately. Look at completing the chores and doing small tasks as little accomplishments; steps along the path. Each step brings another, and you feel better and better about yourself and about life as you progress. 

You sound like a lovely person. If you’ve had bad luck with friends so far, I know you’ll find a good friend (or friends) who lift you up and don’t use/leave you. You don’t need to have a lot of friends; quality over quantity is the goal and I know you’ll find those people in your life soon!
Look into law of attraction! But feel your feelings too release them and then feel the new and good ones!!!
You are worthy and deserving of true friends who treat you with respect. Anything less is just not acceptable. It definitely takes time to recognize the immensity of your worth, but try and give yourself some credit for pulling through despite the cruelties of others. You are stronger than you would ever think! That's something I myself learned from facing similar hardships. And from one gal with glasses to another; you ROCK them!!!
The picture wont load because the internet is bad where I'm at. But I know for sure you are loved by God. He loves you as if there were only you on this earth. He know how talented and smart and beautiful you are. Keep on moving those feet every day.  You'll get to your destination where you'll finally feel how God feels about you.
I find you really beautiful and I'm sure you are loved and you will find something that make you feel worth, because you are :)
You rock those pink nails !  And I love how expressive your glasses are.  People come and go - often enough it has nothing to do with you. Be nice to others but don’t sacrifice yourself. That’s sth I had to learn too. Ppl expect you to always do stuff for them and when you say no they abandon you cause they took what they could.Be true to yourself . Say no more often and say yes only if you can and want to. Be careful to whom you give your time it’s the only thing that never comes back.you deserve better.
First, you're absolutely gorgeous. Second, you deserve to be appreciated. Don't waste time on people who don't value you.
There are alot of crappy people in the world. But there are alot of great ones too. Though it's hard, try to remember that people who have gone in and out of your life may have been awful but their awfulness was not because of you. You are enough!!
It should be a blessing they are out of your life, you don’t want fake friends. The true ones will stay even at the hardest of times. Things will get better.
That sounds *extremely* difficult, and I only somewhat know how that feels, because I had a tendency to be destructive with my past friendships. But I'm sorry you have to deal with that. I'm happy to see you're seeking us out because we want to let you know that you *are* worth friendship, irregardless of the current state of things *exactly* as they are right now. 

I love your hair, too. And you are cute, too. I hope that you will find people who are solid, dependable friends. I think oftentimes while we're younger, people are hardly dependable, at least in my experience. But at least here we can show you love and reassurance as I'm sure you deserve, even though I don't know you at all. 

I'm not sure what exactly I could say to you other than that I'm certain you will have a group of friends that appreciates and recognizes you. It takes time for these things to happen, too. I'm only just discovering people almost every other weekend it seems like that could potentially be friends. It's a rare thing to have a group of solid friends arise out of small experiences with other people. 

But I know you will be okay. :) You will. You deserve goodness from people and good friends.
Don’t worry about people who use you. It’s just a poor reflection on them. If you’re looking for real friends, you can PM alot of people on reddit, who’ll enjoy your conversation, including me. Your skin is really great. Take care of yourself. You’re worth more than you know.
I’m so sorry to hear this sweetie. I think you are adorable and I’m sending you a mom hug. Everyone needs a mom hug. 🤗
You look like a wonderful person to hang around with. Keeping it real like that. How do u manage to do work n still pull of that look. Dw dear friends will surely come along.
If I've learnt anything on reddit, it's that you can't fix others or have them fix you. Focus on yourself and hope for the best. I believe you can do this!!
I’m nearly 30 and I find that finding good friends is really hard for a lot of people. Luckily it’s easy to find friends on reddit as you’ll find a few like minded people. Good luck 💕
Panic attacks suck, but they’re 0.01% of your time on this earth. 

The rest of the time you’re a gorgeous woman with a beautiful life.

You deserve happiness. You’ll get it.
GORGEOUS!!!!!!!!!!!
Be enough for yourself ❤ at the end of the day thats all thats gonna matter.
You are worth it!!
You're not alone, dear, it's tough when friends do that, I know. You're just of a more loyal calibur of person than average, and you love your friends dearly and deeply. It's a good thing. It doesn't mean you aren't enough, it means they didn't deserve you. Eventually friends like us find each other, and we become lifelong friends. You'll find yours one day, just don't lose heart. Not that you could lose a heart that big :)
Just a simple one, but your bangs are absolutely perfect. I've never seen such lovely, even, well-kept bangs.
I see no one but a beautiful young woman. Period.
Being taken advantage of means you are all heart and your friends have none.

You’ll find quality friends in no time. I don’t know about you but I used to have the Disease to Please and my “friends” used me constantly. I stopped hanging out with them and kept my small group of close friends closer.
I LOVE your look. 

Trust me girl, I have been there. I recently learned that I am on the Autism spectrum, and that people take advantage of me without me ever realizing it (which feels awful, btw). 

All you can do is learn and grow from shitty life experiences, and learn how to do things differently. Good luck to you!
I'm no expert but try not to focus on people. Find something you love and get good at it, they will come
You look really nice!  (I just had a similar conversation with my step-mom 90 minutes tree es ago!)  Real friends try to give more than they take. I have many aquantences, few friends, but that's okay!  People leave. Friends try to stay in touch.
You are not alone! Don't worry!
God loves you, personally.  He made you for a wonderful life and a personal relationship.  God doesn't make mistakes. Therefore, you are awesome!  You are worth so much that God sacrificed his only child to pay the penalty for any of your mistakes,  so that you could have a wonderful forever! It's impossible that you could be any more valuable than that!
How people treat you is not indicative of your worth. You are a unique human being with strengths and values. There are good people out there who will treat you with respect and bring out the best in you. Unfortunately they aren't as common, but they are out there. And I hope you meet one soon.
Your hair is gorgeous! The color is stunning and it’s so long! Ever since I’ve worn glasses I’ve wanted to be able to pull of the style of glasses you have, but they’ve never looked good on me. They look great on you! They bring out your eyes and makeup. Also your earrings are really pretty!
Man, you have the ability to make some new friends. Better friends who like you for you!

Also, your hair is stunning!
You didn’t even have to post a picture. 

You are an amazing person. Unique. 

You are beautifully a value to everyone around you.

You are the best. A treasure. Smile.
Wow, you are so beautiful!
You are definitely not worthless , beautiful but not worthless. Real friends can come from afar or be as close  as down the street screen them before you get too close.
You have a pretty face, you will meet someone that will love you forever
They may not be the right friends. It is in no way your problem. I hope you can feel appreciated someday. I hope you can find some awesome people. 

Also, I love your hair, I love your glasses, You're really cute.
You're so purty
You’re sensitive and that’s a great thing to be. A woman who can be hurt by others and still remain gentle is a gem. You’ll find people who adore you and in the meantime love yourself because you’re special and deserving.
Life sucks.  But everyone around you is thinking the same so you’re not alone.  We’re all suffering together each one of us.
Your hair is beautiful! You rock your own look, and that’s cool! Don’t let people get you down, there’s a fine line between friends and fiends, and when you get a good one...they won’t mess with ya, they’re around for all the good and the bad. A lucky person is a person who at the end of their life can realistically say they have 5 core people they can count on...all the rest are just acquaintances...you got this!
Hi there! I just want to let you know you're awesome. Don't let outside circunstances like friends not being kind to you make you lose sight of that. I can tell that your sweet and empathetic, and probably a really great friend to have 😄 and be gentle with yourself, because it may feel bad, but it's just the universes way of putting you on the track to find friends who will grow with you, and stick around for the Long haul. Much love friend, keep your head up.
Your glasses are cool af 👍🏼
You’re a pretty lady with some really powerful glasses! 

Friends can be tough, for we sentimental types are constantly betrayed, as far as we’re concerned. The actions of others do not dictate your worth! 

Breathe! Things will settle down, or heat up, as you are ready for it and need it. 

Hang in there! #catpicture
You look really beautiful.
U have beautiful lips
Love your glasses!
Dammm why are all the eligible singles complete strangers to me haha. Single, worthless and used over here too girl. Just find someone like you, takes a while.

Oh and the toast, you have awfully pretty lips with little curly bits in the corner <3
You take care of your facial appearance really well. Hats off.

How about you do for you, show people that you are more than capable of handling your yourself. Say no to helping once in a while, though politely.  Allow them to realise that you wont always be there to benefit them.
Congrats on doing chores. Also nice hair color.

Let me start off by saying that I totally get that you're coming from a good place with your comments, but you are violating one of our rules, which is no advice, unless the OP asks for it. 

I get that you're trying to help and get to the bottom of an issue, but you are making assumptions about OP, which is unfair and not the point of the sub, and against the wishes of the OP. I would ask you message the mods about concerns you have about our posters in the future. Please don't take this in a harsh way, but comments removed.
[removed]
Also you got 27 upvoats, are you happy? That many people agree with you that i should not post here, okay, i wont.
This is one of the best things I have read in a while. It's heartwarming to know that people like her don't go unnoticed. You're really awesome
not appropriate for this sub.
You can do better of a toast than that.
Sorry. Noted.
Chill
[removed]
I really don't think that was what they was going for, not for you to stop posting, but when you need a toast to let it stay. If you delete it, you can never look back on what was said, advice that truly could have helped you, etc.. It really seems like you're struggling with social issues and depression, and I completely feel for you on those topics, I've dealt with them in my personal life, they are horrific. I don't know what you're going through, but that's what it seems to me. I haven't been on this subreddit long, but a lot of people on here seem more than willing to talk about it all with you that could offer way more help than I ever could. I hope you read this message and feel just a bit better, knowing that a stranger on the internet cares and would like to help. Also, and it may be hard, but smile a bit. You really look like your smile could make the sun jealous with its shine!
I think the upvotes are more for the desire to help you, rather than having you post somewhere else.
You can absolutely post here. That is what this place is for.
You can post here and should when you want too.
Bruhhh come onnnn you posted on one of THE nicest subreddits out there how could you think people don’t care about you specifically?? Nobody cares about karma really it’s just a tool to show which comment is relatable with randoms on reddit. Just chill take a deep breath and dm some of these lovely people if you would like to talk more in depth.
Unfortunately people on reddit down vote just to down vote. Try not to take it personally
Sorry, I’m not good at this
You really do have an adorable smile! 
And somehow, you really seem like a genuinely friendly person (you give off good vibes).

I’m sure your stutter mainly bothers you, but is endearing to others.
Especially to the ones that (will) matter!

Stay true to yourself and I’m confident you’re the kinda guy who can make it in life, whatever making it means to you :)
hey man ! we all go thru life at different paces. there's no written law that you MUST be employed by 26 and MUST be in a relationship. don't be so hard on yourself! 

hang in there! better days are just around the corner
No, you’re awesome
you are a young T Rex my friend. misunderstand but when the time is right you'll rule the roost. stay cool my friend.
Stutters are cute, you look cute, you have a nice smile and there is nothing wrong with you in any way, this is the wrong place for you, and you should know that!
Try a dating app, go out, and most important, build your self confidence, although it's tricky, you can do it!

Have a wonderful day 👍
You’ve got a really nice smile— in fact you have folds on your cheeks from smiling! Tbh that’s adorable.
What employment would you prefer to be doing now?
I don't see any of that, man. I see what looks like a kind, caring guy with a good heart. Confidence lies within. You gotta remember that as long as you're challenging yourself, fighting to be your best, you're awesome. You deserve love and respect the same as everyone else, you're just as valuable as the rest of us. Work hard, shine bright, and everything else will come in time. Stay strong, and good luck!
Fairly or not I always think of a stutter as a sign that someone is smart and excited, two lovely things to be. So when I hear someone with a stutter I think they are an interesting person from the get go. 

Lots good will be ahead for you.
Sometimes finding a job can be difficult and just because you have a stutter doesn’t mean it measures your intelligence. Push through and try and try and try and you will succeed life can be a tough road but it’s harder if you start giving up
You have a gorgeous smile!:D
I often worry this will sound condescending, but I find stutters endearing. The people who matter to you will be patient with it and love you and your (amazing) smile for who you are.
You're awesome too! I know the feeling of not feeling confident all too well, but you can definitely get there! Life can just be super tough sometimes but you hold the strength to pull through! We on this sub believe in you! X
I agree with all the others...stutters are endearing! You have a great smile and seem to have such a positive energy about you! If I saw you irl, I’d totally give you a wink ;) you’re doing a good job, buddy. It’ll get better.
First of all you look bomb as fuck mate, don't let anyone tell you otherwise. And your stutter just makes you more unique, which is always a really lovely thing in my opinion. You'll definitely find a good person to spend your life with, I'll bet my whole paycheck I it. Yeah this sub is quite awesome but you're breathtaking dude
You’re a beautiful person and you deserve love and happiness. The world is a better place because you’re in it. Look at that smile! Also, you have lovely eyes.
If we're awesome, and you're one of us. Then you too are awesome! 

Keep your head up man. Don't worry about not having a partner. Focus on things you enjoy and surround yourself with people with similar values. You seem like a smart guy, I'm sure you'll figure yourself out.
You just look like a really nice person. Like if I just walked by you somewhere, I’d think “he’s probably really nice”.
You're handsome bro! You look like a younger Jason Statham 👍😉
I have a stutter too! We’re made for each other!

Seriously tho. You’re really handsome and have such a sweet smile. Chin up, you’ll get through this. Best of luck for your future ❤️
Hey man I’ve been where you’re at. Don’t get caught up worrying about where you’re at in life, and know that many people take different paths forward. You’re a good looking guy and you’ll eventually find the right person!
Hi. I instantly liked your smile. You look a bit like my son. You will do great when you find a Job that fits you because people will see what a good Person and worker you are.
You look a bit shy but that makes you more endearing. And when you find a relationship that person will see just how amazing you are.
Dont be down, everything will be alright.
Sorry for bad english, it's not my first language
Bro you should definitely do cosplay
You have an amazing smile! Plus your stutter wont matter to people who do care about you!
Edit:Spelling!
Keep going. You will find the dream job. You will find your soul mate. Sure, there will be a little bit of trial and error on both, but it will happen.
You didn't stutter at all in that title!
Hey man, there’s a big economic slump right now. I know a ton of people that are unemployed. My nephew had apraxia and slight stutter and I saw how difficult it was for him. I think a stutter is not the barrier AT ALL to a relationship, so while it’s hard to tell you not to think about it, I wouldn’t dwell on it. A good person will love you stutter or not. They may even find it charming. You also have a very cute face. If I can make one more suggestion, I’d look at new glasses once you’re in a situation where you’re able to afford them:) Zenni has good prices. Your glasses are great, I just think glasses where you could see your face more or ones that are bold would like nice too. 

Either way, you’re great :)
Heyboy I'm a fella so I will leave out the handsome smile chat. Just to let you know I'm where you are but 30 and it'll be alright. Just knuckle down, appreciate the little things and when the good times come, enjoy them.

Nothing about you will hold you back. Persistence will get you anywhere.
I came here to comment something original, but this person said everything I was thinking, probably more eloquently. Only thing I have to add is that you seem pretty handsome, and being bald suits you :)
Something with computers. I've thought about going to college multiple times but the thought of being thousands of dollars in debt because of student loans always puts me off of it. Maybe I just shouldn't worry about that and just go for it.
I can confirm this. The friends I do have that mean a lot to me are patient and understand that I have a stutter. They try not to talk over me but still do from time to time, which is understandable. It seriously means a lot to me when people are like this. Thank you!
Go into some of your state's colleges, even community colleges and price it up, compare, and talk to the counselors and see if there are any grants that you can apply for. You can get ready for your degree path by taking just a  couple classes that would count toward a degree *now*, and start now applying for grants for next year. This will also help get you accustomed to being in school again. 

&#x200B;

During this year of fewer classes, you say you have a stutter, go to a speech therapist and work on that. Getting a degree in computers would be such a satisfying accomplishment, and then hunting for a job. After you get that degree, maybe even moving and starting fresh somewhere in a big city with a big company with lots of employees to befriend. 

&#x200B;

Here you have put a pic of yourself online and asked for advice. That takes *guts.* There's only one person standing in your way. Take those guts and be the change you want.
I was afraid to get student loans, too, but they allowed me to get the degree and therefore the job I wanted, so it was worth it. The fear never leaves, but you are stronger than your fear!
Edit: spelling
What kinda idiot girls are you going after dude?
You're hot! That first pic in the comment above particularly... The red flannel and brown t-shirt... I don't know what it is... Jawline? Something reminds me of a young Reznor swoon worthy really.

Physical attributes aside I did look through your comments and you're a very sweet and sincere guy as well... ❤️
I think you’re a good looking dude and I dig your style! You seem really nice, respectful, easy to talk to—overall, a rare kind of guy to find nowadays. Those girls who have ghosted you are the ones who are missing out (:
Sorry people have been ghosting you... it’s so rude imo. Sometimes people are too focused on themselves to realize how they effect others ya know. I’m so sorry you feel lonely and unloved, I’m so so sure there are people out here that love you and want you around more! Dating is really hard and sometimes can take a long time before something clicks. You’re a handsome guy and I love your style! Especially love the beanie and flannel combo :) I’m sure you’ll find someone who is head over heels for you soon! If you ever need a friend or Even just someone to talk to feel free to shoot me a message I’m always on reddit haha! I hope you have a great week :3
you have style and flair. the wild hair and shirt tells me all. stop slouching and be that alpha beast of the wild.
You honestly have a face that looks like a classical painting, and your style really suits you. 

I’m sorry that people have ghosted you, that’s genuinely bad behaviour of theirs.  Don’t give up though, someone’s out there who will make you smile.
Those girls probably don't know what they're missing out on. You look handsome, have awesome hair(I'm kinda jealous tbh) and I bet my ass you have the goodest heart around. Keep going, do your thing. You'll be happy and loved someday cause you deserve it buddy
Aw man, if I saw you walking around (and had any confidence in my ability to form proper sentences in front of new people) I so would approach you, in a heartbeat. You have that certain laid-back grunge-y style, which I absolutely adore, and I know for a fact I am not the only girl who'd find it extremely appealing.

You are not unloved, useless or unwanted, this is just a way in which *you* perceive yourself, based on your own criticism, as well as those bad experiences that took a toll on your self-confidence. 

It honestly broke my heart a bit to read this, because I feel I often do the same to myself. And it is so incredibly hurtful, because you spend your every waking hour in your own head and there is nowhere to hide really, from those cold allegations. 

And yet I don't think it has to be that way. You are seeking for someone to love you and to give you affection, but for a person who can not really accept themself it's always going to be quite the scary, lonely world. Other people can make you feel that kind of beautiful love and security, but oftentimes when you feel you're becoming attached to your person, the gap between you two grows as one's growing intensity does not quite match the other's. I don't know if this is accurate to you but this is how I have always found relationships to be. Only once in my life have I found an incredible balance between two separate people's minds, and it really did blow my mind. I know you can find it too! That kind of person exists for you, your person, many of them quite possibly, but you just haven't had the chance to get to know them yet. I know that's kind of a cliche thing to say, maybe, but it seems to be true from my viewpoint. 

Sending you a big squeeze and lots of kisses! You *are* wanted and you do have worth, so much so. I hope you'll start feeling better soon, and I wish all wonderful things to happen in your life. <3

I've been exactly where you were. There is a light at the end of the tunnel. Through my experience, I found out that if I didn't worry at all about meeting someone or being in a relationship, that I'd be much happier. So I adopted the policy of "Don't give a damn." So that's exactly what I did and I started doing and experiencing things without worrying about what other people thought. Basically live your life and don't worry about it. Why? Because when you're happy, you're confident, and when you're confident, you're attractive, and when you're attractive................well....the females will start noticing you more and that's when things change. You're already a good looking dude so your foundation is all set. You're not working from zero, you know? So enjoy life and don't worry so much.
Hey friend! You're a good lookin guy, you have a nice hipster-but-one-who-is-cool-and-not-pretentious look. So, I dunno what's going on with the ladies. I've been in a similar place- looooong dry spell, wondering what's wrong with me- all I can say is keep trying and learn from your mistakes. And those mistakes may be the people you are picking, not anything about you or what you're doing. Take care of yourself man!
I don't get many opportunities tbh.. whoever fancies me, i suppose. 🤔

Thank you for saying that
Buddy, my heart can’t take your beauty. Holy macaroni, you’re a goddess. I have actual heart eyes right now. Wow.
You have absolutely stunning eyes, they draw a person in.
You’re beautiful, your makeup is perfect, and your skin is flawless!
You have so many beautiful features 😍 Those eyes, that beautiful complexion and coloring!  I've always considered that dark hair and fair complexion especially striking 🙂
Well I did a bit of homework (ie.. looked at a few posts and read a few comments) and - 

It sounds like work is bringing you down. And I hear you, I really really do. Things WILL get better, because it sounds like you're doing ok otherwise. Try to keep your interests up and find passion in what you can still do and excitement for what you'll be able to do eventually. 

As per the confidence boost: 

You're stunning! 
The dark hair pulled back w those sparkling eyes? Beautiful. You have great skin and know enough about makeup to accent already beautiful features. 

You're also hella brave! Aerial stuff is no joke and that pic of you is fucking fierce. Put that in a frame and own your badassery. 

You sound like a wonderful soul. 
You help people and offer your help and advice. 
Good. For. You. We need more of you in the world.
I need to know what lipstick that is because it's amazing
You are so gorgeous! I love that lipstick on you, it’s so flattering! You also have beautiful eyes! You’re totally rocking it girl! :3
As my Grandma would say, you're a knockout! I bet you are special in a bunch of other ways too ❤️
My goodness you are so gorgeous! Your skin looks amazing and your eyes are stunning! I hope everything is going well for you!
You, Madam, have a regal presence and are an indelible beauty.  You should be so proud of yourself accomplishment in becoming an acrobat.  That must take immense talent and fortitude.  You really are incredible and I can't begin to tell you how impressed I am.  I'm sorry that you're currently experiencing health problems.  I saw your appeal for a friend here on Reddit, and I would be so honored if that friend were me.  If you'd ever like to chat, feel free to PM me.
your eyes!!! they’re beautiful!!!
At first I was struck by how much of the world your eyes hold, but I always try to remember that none of us really know anything about life. You're doing just fine, dear. Life is an organic dance, not line-dancing!
You've got a face that an artist would gladly spend hours painting a replica of. Your eyes are mesmerising.
You are very gorgeous!! I love the minimalist style you have in this picture, the lipstick really brings out your eyes!! I hope you feel as beautiful as you are ♡
Look at those gorgeous eyes 😍
WHAT A GORGEOUS QUEEN! You are so beautiful!
Why do you need a confidence boost? No one with such beauty should need such thing, you should know the truth, that you look fabulous!

Go out and enjoy the summer, show off that pretty face!
I really love the color of your eyes, you look amazing. I hope you're doing well and have a great day!
Your eyes are beautiful
You look stunning!
Your eye shape and -colour are both beautiful, your eyebrows are on point, you have a cute nose, and that colour looks great on your lips!
You are gorgeous.
My literal first thought when I saw your face was "holy crap those eeyees"
You are absolutely beautiful and have amazing eyes!!!
Your eyes are truly stunning!! Keep your head up and shine your way through the day.  😊
I agree with many of my fellow Toasters. BEAUTIFUL eyes, truly. Great skin, great makeup. You're a catch, for real! Get out there, be strong, be confident in yourself, and be kind! You have a lot of good things coming your way. Have a great day 😁
Your lipstick and brow game is amazing. Also I'm super jealous of your ability as an aerialist. You look great and you have cool hobbies. Plus you help out and offer advice to other people who are struggling. You're a good person.
Holy moly. You are so beautiful!😍😍😍 Your eyes are so pretty, and your eyebrows are my eyebrow goals!
The way you do your makeup is so lovely! You've got a talent for it. And this may be a small thing, but your handwriting has a lot of character and is nice and clean, which is a great random quality for a person haha. I hope your day today is going well and you manage to find the best in your week :)
You're beautiful.
Ofra Liquid lipstick in Santorini! 💕
You have an infectious smile, and you rock this piercings better than anyone i have seen, and I am not a fan of piercings.
Your hair color also really suits you!
You should have nothing to hate about yourself when you are such a bright and good looking person!
😍
Hey just had to say that you have fucking amazing eyebrows 😊 Honestly my eye never goes to eyebrows and I never even know how to style my own but wow yours are perfect for your face shape and give such a warm look to your eyes. Sorry it's so random but I had to say something. Hope you're having a nice day! 👌
You look great! 
Your eyebrows and eyes look fantastic, and you have a great smile.
Don’t be afraid to show it ever 

And also, you’ll be okay!
No matter how stressed you are right now, eventually everything will fall into place.
Keep it up
You look so warm and friendly. I bet you’re a really good friend to those around you.
I love your smile and you look like you give amazing hugs. Persevere with college! You are so much smarter and stronger than you know.
You look like the best person to hang out with and have some laughs, nice smile and radiating with good vibes.
You have a warm smile and clear sense of personal identity -- those two things will get you far in life! College is tough but I'm sure you're smart and capable of doing things that are difficult. Be extra kind to yourself during the stressful times :)
I’m crying in the club❤️
Thanks a ton beautiful
Hey, OP, I hope you don't mind that I put a trigger warning on your post. I wish you the very best in recovery, you're an amazing person for having the strength to seek treatment and I'm so very glad you are with us. 

Rule #1 (be kind) will be strictly enforced on this post, y'all.
You've now survived death, you're a bad ass, remember going forward when you feel like you can't beat the odds... You beat death
You’re doing good. You are strong and you can get thru this. You matter.
I hope that you are okay and that treatment will help you. You deserve better than this, and I wish you luck.

 Also a PSA: please never attempt suicide, but do not try overdosing on NSAIDS because they will almost never work and you will need to have your stomach pumped. You could go into a coma. You also will probably have considerable and possibly permanent damage to your organs from internal bleeding. Please call a suicide hotline instead.
This world is better with you in it, glad you're still here.
Keep your head up. You are strong and you are loved. Best of luck to you ❤️
I’m so sorry this happened to you :( stay strong friendo
Your life is precious and you always have another solution. I’m happy that your still alive please don’t ever waste your life. There are people who need you and if you need anyone the people of reddit are here. If you need to vent DM me!
i had a v similar experience. wasnt voluntary for the psych ward after so hope youll have a better time since you want to be there!
Oh my dear, I’m so sorry that happened but I’m
Awfully happy you’re still with us. You have a friend right here if you ever need one!
I'm wishing for a quick recovery. I know you can get through this. I'm happy you're getting help. I hope it works.
Oh heeyyy, post yours and her name too.  I want to send you both gifts.
well you both look movie star pretty hope the hospital helps with the depression
Its surreal from time to time and all seem worthless but remember in those times that life is a miracle and each day gonna pass faster than the last our time is very limited we dont need to shorten that. If the pain overwhelmes your sould remember that existence is a flash in the infinity of time itself. Dont give up yet try to find purpose.
I've been there. Being in the mental health hospital was really helpful and healing for me. I hope that you will have a similar experience. There's a reason you're still here. Shine bright, beautiful warrior. You have much ahead of you.
You are an amazing person. I wish you all the best in life to come!
You have very beautiful eyes.  I'm really glad you're okay and hope everything goes well. I believe in you and won't stop doing so
I’m so glad youre still here! I hope you have a speedy recovery and start to feel better soon! If you ever ever need a friend or someone to talk to please reach out and I’ll be here as a friend or just a listening ear. I’m so glad you’re on track to get better. I’m sending you such good vibes and positivity right now. 💜
You are worthy. Sending so much love to you!
Wishing you a speedy recovery!! Thank you for still being here.
You're so much stronger than you think you might be right now. YOU are amazing, beauiful, and have so much to live for. If you're a fan of Game of Thrones, just know that Arya Stark has nothing on you. Somewhere, a little part of you said "Not today" and I hope you continue to say that to the negativity and downsides of life, you beautiful human being.
I’m so sorry that you were in that position, but you’re doing an incredibly brave thing. I wish you all the best in life!
I can't add to all the kind words already said...so many caring toasters in here!

But I can add this... Almost died back in 2003 due to an act of violence (terrorists).  Sometimes, I wish I did die.  On those days, I play happy music and think good thoughts.  I survived my awful event.  You'll survive this.  Life, even on the bad days, is better than the alternative.

You are strong and the world needs you in it.  This sub-reddit, every member, wants to hear from you during your recovery.

Get better.  Post again soon so we can toast your recovery and your inner strength. You are loved.
Congratulations on taking the first steps for self help, after having hit rock bottom. It is a long hard road, but the first step in the right direction is the hardest. Every step after this brings more momentum. You’ve got the strength to start the journey, you’ve got the strength to see it through. Your story isn’t over.
I know you are as beautiful inside as you are outside,  and I know you are strong and can make it threw this and I'm glad you are getting help,  don't ever feel like you are in a situation like that and you have no one to talk to,  if you are ever feeling that way again or just need to vent feel free to message me... and there are plenty of subreddits on here that can help, keep your head up!
I don't know what's your pain, but I wish nothing but the bestest recovery. Life can be painful but you have so much to live for. You're a beautiful soul in and out.
Hello I hope you will feel better soon.  I'm sorry you are sad xx x
You're seeking help, which is the first and hardest step. Know that you are beautiful, you have value, and you have the potential to make the world a better place. Keep working, keep fighting, and the sun will rise. You have my word. Stay strong ♥️ We care about you and we will always be here for you.
Proud of you for going to get help, I’ve benefited greatly from therapy and being put on medication. Hang in there, everything takes a bit of time.
You have been through hell... 
You are so brave for seeking help, accepting it.

It is not a fatality, feeling that bad is not a fatality. 
With help, with time, you ll feel better.
With help, and time, You ll learn to look at yourself with kindness, and love, because everyone deserve to see that in themselves. 


I really wish you all the best, I hope you are surrounded, loved. 
Stay strong, cause you are strong, hold on, some days will suck. Some days won't. You'll find that balance. It will get better.
As someone who’s been in a similar situation, I promise it won’t always be like this. I won’t tell you some bullshit like “it’ll get better!” (because I hate that) but I will say that there will be better days, later on. 
I’m so glad you survived, and I hope that someday you can look back on this and be happy that you lived too. I’m sending so much love your way, just think of the things you’ll get to see and do when you get out of inpatient! 
For me it was cats, climbing, baths, and mashed potatoes. 
If you ever need someone to listen, Ive been there and a message is always welcome.
The worlds a rough place but it looks like your body isn't ready to give in, you cleary have the tenacity to keep kicking!

You conquered the coffin now live life!

The world needs you & people need you!

You can do this!!
Oh sweetheart, I'm so glad you made it. Nearly lost a sister to this once, and I've been there myself, though not that method. I'm pretty familiar with the pain around all this. It takes a good deal of bravery to keep going, and definitely takes some courage to reach out for that level of help, so you should feel proud of yourself for doing so. I know it doesn't look or feel like this will end right now, but you'll come out on the other side of all of this, and see how worth it the struggle was. You are loved, dear.
Though I never folloed through with actions, there was a period in my life where I felt no desire or motivation to live. I know it may or may not help, because honestly it only did so much for me when I was suicidal, but please know that you are very deeply loved. It's good that you're seeking help though;  a lot of people would refuse out of pride. Take care, my dear friend, and if you ever need someone to talk to, you're always welcome to PM me.
The reason you did not succeed is because you are destined to something greater. 

Take the time you need for self healing, and keep your chin up. You will prevail over this all. I believe in you.
You look so beautiful. You look so thoughtful.

I am very depressed any have tried the deed before. I dont understand, I truly don't know why.

I wish you nothing but the best in truly defeating your demons.

You can have a happy life. You deserve happiness and smile faces.

Hang in there - I know those words don’t mean much when you are in the middle of fighting a bout of depression but give it a little time and things will improve. 

I know you have some strong willpower just by the fact you hung in there and got your teaching degree at 40. Continuing education later in life is something a lot of people talk about but not as many are able to actually follow through on because it takes some real effort. You did this and should see that as a strength of yours regardless of if it’s been a nightmare so far. Teaching puts you in a position to be an inspiration to others even if it’s on a small scale, so you are doing some good in this world, don’t let the depression fool you into thinking otherwise.
You’re doing a good job, buddy. I’m proud of you for trying every day, even if it feels like nothing is going right. You have a very kind face and I like your eyes. They’re very expressive. I hope you keep your chin up!
Teaching is a noble profession! It takes a big heart, a smart brain and a desire to make a difference. Those are awesome qualities that you possess friend!  Getting your degree at 40 is also pretty awesome! Nightmares don’t last forever- you’ll wake up soon:)
You must have a big heart if you have your teaching degree. Also, you look like Rainn Wilson's handsome twin brother. Please hang in there, man.
I really like your hair and your beard, they are very nice!! Your glasses go with your handsome face very well, good choice!! I hope you can find a good job with your new degree, congrats on it by the way! It's not easy to finish studying, I'm very proud of you ♡
Your beard is majestic!
You look like the type of guy that would be a great teacher, go be your best :)
Getting a degree is such an achievement, especially when you’ve done it as someone a bit older juggling the commitments and experiences we don’t have in our late teens. It’s really something to be proud of. 

And teaching is such a caring profession, wanting the responsibility to educate children and help them grow into their future selves is so noble and shows you have a huge heart and a clever mind. 

Depression will tell you otherwise, and it sucks because of it, but you’re doing an amazing job.
Please don't give up hope, I bet you are an amazing teacher as long as you keep your heart in it, just try and do your best and if it just an obstacle you just can absolutely not overcome school wise than just look for a better working environment,  keep your head up and I hope you have a great week!
I just finished my first year teaching! Don't get discouraged. There's a student out there that needs an educator like you. You're going to make a huge difference someday, but you just have to keep going! Welcome to one of the most fulfilling careers there is!
I would seek you out as a teacher if I were still a student because you come across as the kind of teacher who cares a lot and wants to be sure your students learn. I'd appreciate your commitment and what I suspect is a kinda quirky outlook on life. I bet you've made a difference in a lot of students' lives and don't even know it.
Depression is so hard; I'm so proud of you for getting your degree and making progress through all the difficulty that comes with that. Keep doing what you can to move in the direction you want to go; you're doing amazing so far!
I’m a professor at a state college, and it breaks my heart to see this happen to my students - think of every night you stayed up late to finish a project, or to write a last minute paper, or to study for an exam. Think of every awkward presentation you survived and  all the annoying group projects. People who say you’re bright may be right, but what’s more important than being bright is being dedicated and persistent and trying so damn hard it hurts. I’m sorry you feel so tired, and I’m sorry it probably feels like you came all this way for nothing. But you’re someone who deserves the life you want. If that means taking a break for your mental health to come back stronger, ok. If that means being careful and pushing through, ok. If that means you’re satisfied where you’re at, that’s ok too. Nobody else gets to tell you where you want to go - you have the agency and aptitude and ability to do whatever it takes to make you happy. I hope things start feeling better for you soon
You right the date like a civilised individual. That says a lot on its own
“I’m a bright girl BUT I just feel like a tired girl”

Bright and tired aren’t opposites, you’re probably both. Just take a break or a gap year or something and come back at it fresh, you got this!
Not finishing your degree is okay. Finishing your degree is okay. You are your priority - do what is best for you.

If university is hurting you more than helping take a break, come back later, find a different university/ college/ program. This is YOUR choose your own adventure and YOU are the heroine.
You only have 2 papers left. You're so close. You can do it.
It’s okay to take a break if you need it. I took a break too to gain clarity and life knowledge, and I’m so so glad I did. You can go back when you feel ready! It’s ok to focus on yourself and get yourself in the right headspace to complete college. If you’re that close now then it’ll be that much easier to go back when you’re ready. I hope you feel a little less tired and more motivated soon because I know you’ve got this! If you ever need a friend you can always reach out to me! Otherwise have a really wonderful week :3
Fuck that! Go do what you love. If you are happy with a fast food job, stay! If you’ll be happier with a job pertaining to your major, get after it! You look happy in the pic, so do whatever made you feel like this.
Finish uni...you can do it!
Do what you need to feel healthy. I want to tell you to get those two papers done - it’s just two more - but you know what you need to feel healthy. 

Even if you don’t go ahead with those papers, life isn’t over, your future is still so full of promise and opportunity. 

Look after yourself.
Everyone struggles sometimes! Things might be hard right now, but those times come and go. Things will get better. Work hard, persevere, and stay positive. You're going to do just fine! Remember that we're all here for you and we believe in you!
You can be both incredibly bright, awesome, etc, and still be tired and deserve a well-needed break! You've got classes and experience under your belt and can always pick back up someday if that's the right path for you. Do what you need to pursue what fits you best; in time things will work out. You have every right to rest and prioritize yourself as long as you need to; we believe in you!
I feel that burn out, friend. That tiredness is familiar to me. You're so damn close though, please don't give up now! You deserve way better than some pizza place, and the world deserves to see what your talents can do!
Your facial features are adorable! Everything from your lips to your eyes, there is that soft feminine glow. The bangs suit you very well and I love how you did your eye makeup. Wish I could get my wings that sharp.
You are adorable! You remind me of Zoey deschanel (newgirl era) or Lily Allen, you have such cute features! The doe eyes, the cute lips, the button nose. And you have great eyeliner too!
You are really cute. You really pull off those bangs. Also, you have beautiful eyes.
The bangs and eyeliner is a hell of a look -  love it. Life is about momentum, and I’m so glad to hear that you’re feeling it start to pick up!
You look amazing!!
Hey you look great dont know how you usualy look but i agree cute and powerfull. Whatever you wanna archive i believe you can do it.
Kinda cute? Super cute.
Fantastic eye makeup!  And your bangs are too cute!
Totally cute! You have a very pretty face and your eyes have a sincerely deep look to them!
I seriously love your look! I wish I could get my wings that sharp and smooth! I also love love love your bangs on you! They really compliment your features! You’re super cute! I hope you have a really great day!
Woah. Anyone tell you that you kinda look like Rashida Jones from the movie, "I Love You Man"?
Dayum. Bundle of Cuteness😘
Your features are super cute! Love the make-up and the bangs as well
You should feel *hella* cute girl!
You are incredibly cute...love the entire look..it’s a very natural look that is simple alluring and still showing your personality.
You are ridiculously adorable!
You are beautiful in that picture!! Such pretty eyes, I hope your day is amazing!!
Gorgeous. I love your makeup, I LOVE your bangs. Cute top too. 10/10. Have a great day 😁
You are super cute! First off, I instantly noticed your pretty eyes and your eyelashes, totally adorable. You have great bone structure and your skin looks amazing, and even your hair looks great. Keep doing whatever it is you're doing, because you're rockin' it, girl.
You have a real talent for makeup! That's so awesome and artistic, and your bangs are so lovely :)
Hi there! Sorry, your post got flagged by our automod. I have approved it now, but feel free to repost for more exposure!
You have such nice eyes, I could look at them all day, everyone deserves to feel confident in themselves and I’m sure you can find it if you believe in yourself!
Will do (:
Hi there! Sorry, your post got flagged by our automod. I have approved it now, but feel free to repost for more exposure!
Woah I'm sorry to hear about your surgery but I hope you make a quick and easy recovery! It's like 2am for me so my overtired brain is noticing the most spazz details but you have gorgeous nail beds and it looks like you do a really nice job of maintaining them! Self-care is always super important so make sure that you specifically take some time out of your days to pamper yourself and de-stress especially since you're likely on edge from surgery and having to buy new glasses. I'm sending you lots of good vibes and wishing you the best! Hope you feel well soon! 😊
Hope you’re recovering well a few hours on, and you’ve been able too get some decent rest.
Okay, a bit of a rough spot, but nothing you can't handle. In fact, you come across as the kind of guy who takes care of business. If you were in my friend group and I needed a straight answer, or help moving my sofa, or a hint to level up, or a ride to the airport, or help painting the living room, or just someone to vent to, I know who I'd call.
He wanted a toasting but got compliments instead. Humans are becoming kinder (?)
You have symmetrical ears. Sounds weird but balances out your face and highlights your lovely eyes. 

I second the comment about your nails - men often forget to keep their nails neat and it makes a huge difference! Keep up the good work and this too shall pass.
Proud of you for getting through a surgery! No matter the reason, that's always tough and requires so much strength. Get some rest and take good care of yourself in the coming days/weeks. If your friends are busy, then it's just an opportunity to invest in yourself and things you love and get some needed rest
I think you’re looking for /r/RoastMe. /r/ToastMe is about compliments
The league is a myth. Find your passion, follow it, then the right companion will follow. You're young, and so much is ahead of you. You look like a great friend of mine back at 18. He's a great guy, and I'd like to think you are as well
I see a young man with tons of potential. dont waste it feeling sorry for your self. Work on your weaknesses if you think you need to but don't be surprised if you already have the skills to pay the Bill's.
I also feel like everyone is out of my league. Like I’m just surrounded by beautiful people. My friends, my siblings, random people on the street, they’re all just so much better-looking than me. But it can be kind of liberating in a way. That means there’s nothing stopping you from shooting your shot. If your base expectation is to just take any possible rejection and keep living your life, then there’s absolutely nothing stopping you from pursuing whatever romantic or platonic ventures your heart desires.

Also, maybe look into starting a little self-care/grooming regimen. It doesn’t have to be expensive or time-consuming, just a few things you consistently do in the morning or when you go to bed—a nice facial scrub, a moisturiser, whatever you want. I found that made me feel better and more put-together. Best of luck, mate.
You look like the actor Michael Angarano, which is definitely a compliment haha you’re attractive
What league?!?! We’re all playing the same scary game. You just got to find what your good at and roll with it. You don’t look like a bad looking guy, but you do look sad. I would right a list of all the things you like about yourself, you honestly have to start treating yourself better. Your only 18 a lot can change over time, your still trying to find yourself and that’s okay, just enjoy yourself the best you can.
How are other people out of your league?  You look like a wonderful companion and a genuine joy to be around.  You're no less worthy of others' companionship than they are of yours.
Hey! First of all, love your glasses and the hoodie. Black hoodies over all else. You're a good looking guy, and I'd bet your personality is perfectly fine too!! 

I know rejection can be hella scary and hurtful, but if you don't try you'll never know! I would bet there is someone interested in you and you don't even know it. 

Also, you're only 18. I know I've changed a *ton* since I was 18 and that was only a few years ago. If there's something you genuinely don't like about yourself, don't be afraid to change it! I used to hate my style, so I changed it. And my hair, so I dyed it. I also used to have horrible social anxiety, so I worked on that! If you- not someone else- YOU, have something you dislike about yourself, you can work on it! But don't change for anyone else. I personally don't see anything that I would change, though.(:
I don't know much about your personality, but I bet you're pretty nice. If everyone is out of your league, there's no hope for the rest of us. I don't see any reason for someone not to like you.
You look like the kind hearted TV character that everyone secretly loves and is funny and always is just a warm person to be around!
Looks like you have stubble which is a really good start. Honestly forget about leagues man, the idea takes away so many opportunities some people you'll connect with others you won't. Don't let yourself miss a chance to be happy with someone because you or someone else believe they're in a higher league take a chance it hurts more thinking about what could happen then finding out. The worst that'll happen is he/she says no, it hurts for a bit you probably wonder why then you probably move on if you don't do anything you torture yourself over the potential and possibly miss out on another great person.
You have a really charming smile and (weird, I know) brows! I may not know your personality but I really understand the feeling of "everyone around me is better than me". Most of the people around you are thinking the same thing! And if you want a confidence boost, a hairstyle change-up, an elevated outfit and other self-care usually lifts me up a bit.
Goat Overlord is damned right. It's not about leagues. Tell you what. Ditch that hood, get yourself a sharp trim, and shave. Dress clean, fresh. Don't be afraid of yourself man. I used to feel really bad about myself, the way I look, and I hid from what I could be. One day, I decided I'd start dressing outside what I had done before. I went for some newer fashions, some dressier stuff. Started getting looks. It brought me up a lot. Got myself a trim and started talking to people, and before long, I met the girl I love today. You gotta put yourself out there. It's scary, but stay confident and trust yourself. You'll get where you wanna go. I promise. Good luck man 👍
At least with girls, looks are only your foot in the door. Girls care less about appearances and more about personality. We might notice attractive guys when we're out, but if the personality doesn't work then it doesn't matter. If you have other ways of getting a girl's attention, and a personality that makes her want to stick around, then you'll be okay. Most successful relationship are compatible people listening to each other and living life together. If you can listen to someone and you're capable of compassion and empathy, then you have a good shot of making it in the romance department. If you're hanging out on a subreddit meant to lift other people up, then I think you have a lot of kindness in you or at least a desire to seek out positivity in life.

As a girl, I can really only speak for what I feel/my friends feel so this is based on that. If you're into dudes then I don't really have much insight.

That being said, I actually think you're pretty cute. You have nice lips and pretty eyes.
You miss 100% of the shots that you don't take. I'm sure your personality could win a lot of girls (or guys) over, don't give up if they reject you either, just move on to another person when you feel attracted or feel a connection.
Thank you means alot alot
Cheers mate thank you
Thank you so much deifntly will look into that
Thank you I don't fully see it but I'm glad someone does
Thank you and you defintly hit the nail on the head with the sad bit
Thank you Legit everyone here has been so nice and wholesome
Thank you so much I forgot to mention in my post and will edit but my main insecurity is defibtly my hight
Thank you wish real life was a t.v. show
Got a massive fear of rejection but for real thank you
Thank you that means so much I really want to change my looks
Oh gotcha! Well honestly I wouldn't worry too much about it. IMO, guys care about height more than girls do. Of course there are those girls who only date guys over 6ft or whatever but if someone is really willing to write someone off because of their height, they likely aren't a super quality person anyway...

I've dated a guy the same height as me and it was nbd before and while we were together, and had nothing to do with us breaking up. We were together for two years!
Man me too, but mine would be a tragic comedy lol, but I'd love to have my own theme song and narrator!
So did I and it took me ages to ask people out I'm almost 19 and didn't ask anyone out properly till like 16 or 17. The fear of rejection may always be there but you just got to remember that it's better to have closure.
Thank you so much I needed to hear that the tonight
Make one for yourself live your best life
I'm going to really try and fix my life in that way
No problem!! You seem like a really great guy, I wouldn't stress the "league" thing too much at all.
That's good to hear man wish you luck! Message me if you want to chat about anything. The first few times I asked someone out I needed friendly peer pressure haha.
Thank you so much I see leagues as everyone else then me you
Thank you means so much to have more people to reach out too
You are a beautiful young woman who I hope not only reaches 18 but goes many many decades past it and I’d be happy to wish you a Happy Birthday when the day arrives.  Here if you need a friend to talk to and I’ve toasted you before hope these word make you as happy as the previous did.
Girl your eyebrows are absolutely perfect! And idk if you're wearing contour or just have incredible cheekbones but either way you look beautiful! I hope you have a good birthday and that you see many more
I hope you make it til your 118th (and that you find love, meaning and happiness along the way)!
You are a cute young women. If you need to talk I can listen or talk. I am sure a lot would do the same. Hugs if you need one.
At the risk of using a cliche: It gets better. I strongly recommend that you see a therapist or enter into a partial hospitalization program. In particular I’d look into Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). And if things get really bad, please call the national suicide prevention hotline: 1-800-273-8255

Anyway, I’m sure you are a wonderful person with the whole world ahead of you. You’re certainly not alone in your struggles. Reddit will no doubt come out of the woodwork to tell you you’re amazing (as we should!) But don’t forget to tell yourself the same thing!

You’re amazing! Please take care!
Feeling anxious about your body is normal. I am a 30s dude and in the best shape of my life, and still body shame myself. None of us are perfect, but we chase it until we die. It's not a healthy thing, tbh. You are young, healthy, and pretty. You have a whole life ahead of you, and I pray you make it to 90. Fuck 18. Live long, thrive, and prosper. Everything is what you make it, and you 100% can do this.
You’re a beautiful girl. I know it’s hard to look in the mirror and not like what you see. Know that it is a real phenomenon, seeing yourself differently and in a more negative way than you actually are. I not only hope you make it to 18, I hope you make it to 88 and beyond. Don’t let the unrealistic standards enforced by the media and society make you feel bad about yourself. You’re gorgeous, you’re capable of growing up to enjoy a beautiful long life, you deserve to live a happy and long life, you are loved by many even if it doesn’t feel like it some times. You’re not alone and you’re worth saving! 

please contact crisis line by texting HOME to 741741

Or call 1-800-273-8255

❤️
You are perfect exactly how are you looking, you have no reason to hate your body or selfharming
you are a young woman with a great life ahead of you. if you feel you need help dont be afraid to find it.
Went through your post history and I love all the different hair colours and styles! You're obviously going through a lot of pain right now and I've been there, just know that there will always be someone who loves you or cares about you even if you don't feel that love for yourself someone else is. I hope that in time you can begin to love yourself again and enjoy everything life has to offer. If things get to bad please get help you have so much to offer the world and you're so full of potential! You can message me if you want to talk as I'm sure you can many others here.
Your worst critic will always be yourself. Please dm if you wish to vent I would love to listen and maybe help out if I can. You have a friend right here and I hope venting helps over self harm.
Oh, honey you are a sweet beautiful young lady. Please find someone to talk to and help you with your struggles. Our minds are our worst enemies. You have so much life ahead of you but I assure you this chapter will close and a new beautiful one will begin. Hugs and prayers 🌹
Girl, you got this awesome nose that women go to plastic surgery for. I am not even kidding! Can you imagine there is woman out there who feel like they are not good enough, so they go and pay money to have what (it seems to me like) God has given you? I know, that’s crazy right? Who determines what is good about us and what is not? Who says this is beautiful or it is not? You are perfect the way you are and you are awesome the way you are. Since you were born. Because you are alive. Please be brave enough to believe this. Now!
You're lovely. I truly mean that. I know you might not think so or feel like it, and that's ok. We all have times when we feel like that. I know I do. You don't have to be perfect (whatever that means), just be true to who you are. That's real beauty. You're flawed and fabulous just like the rest of us. And you have such gorgeous eyes too.  I'm here if you need a friend or someone to talk to, any time.
Girl you are beautiful and I’d love to be your friend! Keep your head up things will get better trust me! 💕
Very Cute face and nose very big nice eyes perfect eyebrows nice lips damn you are a beauty. I mean that doesnt mean you cant feel hatred towards yourself but looks shouldnt be a issue. Maybe do something for the community or help out at a animal shelter or whatever you feel like. I believe we love ourself more if we feel helpfull towards our community.
you look similar to the swedish lisbeth salander from the films.

hopefully you may be able to switch or continue at least harming in ways that dont leave marks. i always just squeeze my arm really hard or something. i have some marks from stupid times i'd rather forget but theyll always be there now. not many or prominent, im glad for that.

i dont rly celebrate my birthday or any holiday really, but i hope you find something fun to do or some tasty food at least like me.

you look like me, guess thats why im comparing. ppl call me hot and whatnot but i havent found my looks to help me in life.
I'm sorry to hear you think of your body that way. You're quite cute, with an expressive face that speaks to a sensitive heart that feels things deeply and powerfully. That big heart is a wonderful trait that you should treasure about yourself. 

I wish I could tell you how I got out of where you are now, but I'm not really sure, to be honest. All I know is that it looked like an endless darkness going into it, but I did come out the other side, and I'm so glad I kept going. There were definitely times I wouldn't have kept going if kind voices hadn't been there to guide me forward. I hope we can be those kind voices for you. 

Keep going, sweet girl! You will come out on the other side, I assure you, just keep going! You're a humble and selfless person that just wants love and belonging like we all do, and you will find it, I promise, so long as you keep going! The world needs more wonderful people like you, with that big heart of yours, so keep going! You're gonna make it!
What I came to learn going to therapy because of my anxiety and insecurities is that everything that happens in your mind is part of what you, consciously or unconsciously, are telling it to be.

The hate and the sickness we all have is part of how we define ourselves and our story. We are narrators and protagonists or our story. We are, without wanting it, us and our friends. Think about what would you do if you find a friend in your situation, and apply that to yourself.

Learn to be your own friend, and to not hate yourself. I don't hate you, why would you?

I hope this helps.
You know, you are beautiful. Really. You are. Every feature of yours is soft and sweet and looks like it was sculpted to melt hearts. But beyond that, you look like someone who is willing to listen, willing to care, someone people can trust. People like you make the world okay, make the world less scary for everyone. I hope you find your purpose, and I hope things get better for you. I believe in you. You're gonna do a lot of good for the world.
You are young and beautiful. Please don’t self harm. I did in my youth (I’m slightly older than you) and still carry the scars with me today. I know this sounds cliche but, you have your whole life ahead of you. 

I always tell myself - hold on for one more day. Life can be downright brutal, but I’m still here. I’ve wanted to check out countless times, but I’m still here. Please hang on, there are better days on the horizon for you.
You're really pretty. Also, I'm giving you all the support in the world. I wish there was some way to help.
You are a beautiful young girl! There is no reason to hate or hurt yourself. You would look a lot prettier with a smile, though :)
Dude youre fucking gorgeous what are you talking about

Get that self deprication outta here youre obviously too good for that shit
You have so much value. Your memories and experiences right now are hard. But one day you will look back on these days as a stronger woman... and you'll have the wisdom you need to guide someone else through a similar, dark path. You're the brightest light to someone you've yet to meet.
Dude we are in pretty similar situations and while I can't say anything to make it better I can say that I see you in your struggle, I know how it can feel and that I believe in you even though you don't. Be gentle with yourself and it is okay to be really not okay. Stay safe man, you're valuable.
I’m so sorry that you’re in the situation you are, but honey I promise that things will get better. I know everyone says that, but I cannot stress to you enough the truth of the statement.

You may not see it in yourself, but (like all of these comments) I agree with the fact that you are beautiful, and I’m not just saying that because of the context of the sub.

Self-love is a life-long journey that takes time and commitment, there’ll be dips and peaks like with any path to a goal, but you can do it! You deserve to see the wonderful things life has to offer in the future, not just experience the shitty things you’ve been dealt now. You can do it, I promise, I’m here to talk if you need me!
You're hot as fuck. Not sure what you dont like about yourself. 🤷🏻‍♂️
You're a beautiful girl, and there's so much life ahead of you. I had similar thoughts at your age... I'm only 25 now, but so much better. Life gets better if you let it. Also, I'm very jealous of your perfect skin. Mine...... was not.
Your a very beautiful young lady. I know it hard but just know that sometimes we don’t see how beautiful we actually are, inside and out. Please reach out to loved ones or anyone you trust, I know they care about you. Sending love and good thoughts your way ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
There’s a reason why you are here in this world. None of us know why anymore than you do. But you will find out one day. Along the way you will change lives, cause ppl to smile, show an animal the only kindness they’ve known-many things. Some you may never know about. Stay with us. We need you.
Happy Birthday! You're stunning!
I'm so incredibly jealous, I wish I looked like you. Your face is perfect and I love your hair
You look amazing and I love your eyes
Sharp looks ! 😍
Ariana Grande
Without any sexist/chauvinistic meaning and as it has been mentioned: You are a beautiful young woman and as corny as it sounds but you got the whole life just ahead of you. I´ve been badly depressed and honestly at my lowest point of life around 22 and i´ve had same thoughts as you. In the end truth being that those moments when i´ve been deeply down has built my character.. like a lot ! 11 years later i haven´t come up with moments as bad as those 11 years ago, nothing has felt as bad as moments back then and yet again i´m happy that i had that phase. You´re much harder to break down when you´ve gotten out of the "pit".

&#x200B;

I wish nothing but the best for you. You will get through this, i´m sure of it ♡
I hope you make it to 99, I hope your life is as bright and beautiful as you are,  I hope it is full with so much love that you barely can even remember these bad days.... its raining but it won't rain forever... and when that sun finally shines threw and you can fill the warm kiss of the sun on your heart, you will know there will always be better days ahead if you don't give up hope!
No matter what you're thinking about yourself, know that someone is thinking about you, and cares about you and your future. You're right at the cusp of adulthood and have plenty of time to make a mark on the world, and I'm sure that a young lady as lovely as you has a big mark to leave.
whyyyyyyyyyy you're so beautiful
You're so pretty just like that elf lady from Lord of the Ring,  i hope you will live long and happy life just like those elves :).
I self-harmed for five years, but now I've been clean from it for nearly four. It's a long process, but the key is giving yourself grace. You're allowed to feel this way, and your emotions are valid. You're not a mistake, a failure, or a waste of space. You're a loved and valued part of the world, and the world is lucky to have you in it.

And on a lighter note, your eyebrows are gorgeous :)
Here. I dedicate this gold to you to let you know that you are perfect. Reddit cares about you and so do I. Please for the love of God, do not harm yourself in any way. You are a beautiful woman and there is nothing wrong with your body. I need you to promise me that you won't do this anymore and live your life to it's fullest. I too can't stand my body and I refuse to go outside with my friends because of it. I hope you make it past 100. If you need someone to talk with, I'm right here and I have nowhere to be.
Thank you, they do make me just as happy as the previous did ♡
I ran out of contour product the day before actually,  thank you  ♡
Thank you ♡
Thank you, I'll  get back to your offer when needed ♡
Thank you so much ♡
Thank you, this actually  helped a lot ♡
Your welcome
Way to go getting the needed paperwork. Cheers to you and your gf and a wonderful life together!
Congrats! I am going through visa/legality issues too and just yesterday I had the amazing feeling of getting an extension for my visa that I really needed! Cheers to us for sticking through stressful immigration systems. 🍻
Your gf is a lucky lady
Hey man wish you both lots of luck and love in hard times as well as those great opportunitys to celebrate like now. You look like fun but still responcible, good combo.
Congrats 🎈
Hell yeah, my man! Congrats on that! I don't know how you have clear skin with that long hair, but you're doin something right!
So handsome. I'm sure your girlfriend feels lucky to have you and is thrilled you'll be here with her!
Congrats on the start of something amazing! Good luck to you and your girlfriend!
Congrats! Good luck in the UK, also I can’t remember his name but you look a lot like the guy who plays Bucky Barns.
That’s awesome.  Welcome, we are happy to have you!  Enjoy the celebration and the time with your girlfriend!
Don't listen to the guy on RoastMe who said you look like you got kicked out of a Christian Rock band. You look like the cool frontman for the only Christian Rock band I'd bother listening to. Stay strong, believe in yourself, and kick ass. Good luck and welcome home.
Congratulations!
awesome!!!!! congrats
That is amazing! Starting that with my boyfriend now, he's in the UK and I'm in the US. Congrats and any advice?
congratulations my friend. throw a party
Congratulations!!
Ferocious and handsome
Good job! Getting those paper is a full time job in itself...not the easy task most people think it is.

&#x200B;

Enjoy your new home!! :)
You did an amazing job! Keep working! Head up stranger!
you have awesome hair and i'm so glad for you! good luck with everything :)
That is amazing!!!
Would sending virtual confetti & the song “Celebration” to you and your girlfriend be acceptable???


This is awesome!! 

I don’t know if the first two things are acceptable but just know that this Internet Stranger is celebrating with both of you in spirit!! Congratulations!! 

P.S. I don’t know what the process is from here with the paperwork but wishing you both the best & a celebratory evening.
You have a very kind face. Are you in the US? Welcome if you are!
That's great!
Best of wishes on your life in a new place!
I know this probably sounds weird, but as a chronic nail biter I’m here to say you have some very healthy nails, and I’m jelly. Congrats to you and your girlfriend!
Congrats! Was reading through the comments and wondering why everyone was being so nice. Realized it wasn’t r/roastme!
Dope hair, as with most long haired men. 

And a bit more on the odd side of toasts: I really like your fingernails. They look well maintained and are a nice length. Very aesthetically pleasing
Fuckin love the hair dude
Congratulations!! My now-husband and I went through the same thing a few years ago. It can be so frustrating, but both of you endured the process together because of your love.

You are a lovely person inside and out, and you and your gf are very lucky to have each other!
Congratulations! I hope you guys are happy together !
Dude, I spent two years long distance with my now wife before I got my visa and could move to the US to marry her. The feeling is just euphoric, isn’t it?

You’re one of the fortunate ones, and especially so because you have someone wonderful to be with. Cheers to your joy!
Oh bruh I almost roasted you until I realized what sub I was on lol but anyways congratulations to you for getting your necessary paperwork and to your girlfriend who gets to keep you with her . Best of luck to the two of you mate ! Cheers 🍻
You look like a viking!
You have such a lovely complexion! Congratulations on the paperwork!
you could grow a nice goatee if you wanted.
🍻
That’s awesome! Hope many, many years of happiness are ahead of you.
That's absolutely amazing!!! Congratulations!
Congratulations!!! A new adventure begins. :)
Congratulations! Must be a massive relief! Best of luck for the future!
Congratulations! I hope you have a long and happy life together here.
Congrats op! Also, you have got great hair
Dude yay! I hope your gf and you won’t face anymore troubles like this. Also, love your eyes they’re beautiful.
Congratulations! I hope you and your girlfriend celebrate in an amazing way.
Hell yeah! Congrats!
Congratulations to you and your girlfriend! May I ask what country you are originally from?
Patent cute cat videos
Nice! I wish you and your girlfriend the best, and I bet you guys will be good! 😁
You ever see a picture of Kurt Cobain when he was younger? Before Courtney, before fame, before he just kinda drained out? When he was happy, surrounded by friends, and driven in life?  


You look like him from that time frame.
Without having any glance at your girlfriend, I'll still say you have better hair :)
Good shit dude!!  Kick off your shoes and stay a while
As an ex-pat, I know first-hand how stressful that process is. Kudos OP!
aaaa congrats on getting the papers! I'm sure your gf is very lucky to have you in her life!
I wish the two of you the best of luck and many happy years!
cheers!
Congrats! I’ve had to get visa documentation before and the stress and uncertainty can be super taxing on a person. 

I hope you and your girlfriend take some time to celebrate and enjoy the moment together!

It's fantastic you took the steps to be with your love. That takes balls. You're a good looking cat. Just stop smiling at the camera like you just got caught shoplifting lube.
Where ya from? If I had to guess I’d say somewhere around either Russia or Australia. (I’m not good at understanding regional topography)
You have amazing eyes! Not just the physical eyes but your gaze is so deep. Captivated me right away!
Oh, and congrats!
Why don't you look happier?

Thanks this means a lot to me!
Cheers! 🍻
Thanks that's really kind of you :))
Thanks
Thanks for the congratulations and I have no idea either xD
Yes she does and I am very happy to have and be with her to!
Thank you 🍻
Thank you! 🍻
Sebastian Stan.  And I agree!
Thank you!
Well my only advice would be if you really want to be with him then do anything you can to make it happen it will be worth it in the end I tend to live by "nothing is impossible if you really want it"
Yes it is!
UK
Thanks
Just need a longer beard and then I'll be one lol
Sweden and thanks!
I'm the girlfriend and he moved to the uk :)
I'm European but I moved to the UK
I have never been able to smile properly while my photo is being taken. But I'm a happy person in general!
Haha, if that’s what you’re in to
You’re welcome! ☺️
[removed]
UK's not looking great either! Congrats to both of you though, hoping everything goes through and you get to hang around. I'm up in Manchester
Great hair, great five o'clock shadow, good looking dude. I could tell you're the kind of guy who has a big heart.
Dysmorphia sucks but you're aware. You look fine, good even, especially your hair and stub fits you well. Have a nice day or evening or whatever the time is there! =)
Hey man dont know shit about dysmorphia but you look great hope it gets better and cheers to you have a great day.
You look so damn kind. Your eyes honestly tell me a story of a person who’s kind to everyone but themselves. I’ll raise a glass to you my good looking internet friend 🥂. Have a wonderful day, I’m sure you deserve it.
Tough times never last, but tough people do. *~Dr. Robert Schuller*
I'm pretty jealous that you grow full, thick facial hair. I'm 25 and there are still gaps. And love the glasses
You look great!  


Amazing eyes, they give you a very smart and intense look!
First of all, you look great. Genuinely someone I'd be happy to be. Good hair, nice eyes, strong chin. Great set of glasses too, good choice. You look like rock and roll with a jazz streak. Stay strong and stay positive. You got a lot going for you.
Just from looking at the photo, I feel like you have a warm and gentle heart. Your eyes express pain and suffering but there's still resilience shining in you. I'm so sorry you're going through this 💔 It's truly a tough battle and not something anyone deserves. How was your day by the way?
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you, dysmorphia is where you can basically just think only negatively about your body aesthetically so for me it's fat and my hair and dark circles
Awwwww you're sweet, thanks a lot
You arent fat you hair is great and im not sure sure about the third one you mean dark cycle below the eyes? Cause i cant spot them on this picture, maybe the glasses advert the eye. Anyway you looking good man go out there meet more people you will notice no one will think you are ugly.
You’re as fresh as a button! I don’t think I look like that after 8 hours of sleep. Good luck for college, I know you’re going to rock it!
You’re a good looking guy and I wish you all the best at college. I’m sure you’ll do great and I really hope you enjoy it
u look amazing despite not having slept all night, like damn
Your eyes are stunning!
You have a bright future ahead. I just know you're going to do great on college and in life. You're a likeable person, people can tell just by looking at you.
You look great! I’m excited for you to start college, it can be incredibly scary at first but something tells me you’re ready and can handle whatever the world throws at you. Wish you all the best.
You still have your hairline! That's great! I know others at 18 that didn't... Also, dig the clean cut look
You look like wonderful man and you're about to enter what many people consider an incredible period in their lives.  Not only are you going to prepare for your future career, but you're going to learn about the world and yourself in the process.
Fresh as hell, looking good man. Get yourself a nice fade on those sides and you'll be unstoppable. Trust me. College is yours. Good luck 👍
Good luck in college. Hope you get straight A's and make all the friends in the world. But even if you don't, you're still a nice human being who deserves love.
You're going to do great in college. Just do your best in your first semester and you're already doing better than others (seriously there are plenty of people who go straight to partying.) If you get a few C's, don't sweat it, you have time to make up for that. Absorb as much as you can, try to acclimate, and make a friend or two if at all possible. You got this! <3
Fellow HS senior here! College is really scary and if anyone tells you they're not worried, they're lying. It brings me some comfort knowing that everyone else is feeling the same way I am. I'm sure it'll get much easier as we adjust to the new environment, though this isn't going to happen overnight. You look great, and nice hairstyle by the way! 😁💚
Thank you!! Really looking forward to it.
I really hope so too! Thank you!
Thank you!! Had to stay up all night because my favorite team played at 5AM and I knew I wasn’t gonna wake up, decided to not sleep instead.
Need this, thank you!! <3
You only fail if you stop other than that it is speed bumps. Don’t give up and push through just because you had some obstacles doesn’t mean you can’t finish the race. You got it 💪🏻
I failed my drivers 3 times before I got it! These things happen. I know it all feels like a lot at the moment but I know you’re going to be fine - better than fine even! You’re going to be great! When it all feels like too much just stop breath in deeply and remind yourself how much you’ve achieved so far in life. Rooting for you friend!
Im a huge worrier and i do this same thing, i get way ahead of myself thinking about all the things I think i cant handle. I read somewhere that worrying is like praying for things you dont want, and when you worry, you suffer twice. I feel its very true because they more worked up you get yourself in believing you cant do something, the more real it starts to feel and it can become a self fufilling prophecy. 

Whenever i start to get worried about the future and i can feel the anxiety growing and my thoughts spiraling, i try to remember that i can solve all my problems in one day, and sometimes all you can do is put one foot in front of the other, and just take the next smallest step. I know it sounds dorky but i like to think of really simple mantras, just like “i can and i will” or “i can handle this”. 

Hang in there, you got this!
You can do this. Life is 10% what happens to us and 90% how we react. Keep studying. You're a smart person with a great future. Stay strong.
I don't think I know anyone who hasn't failed either the theoretical or practical drivers test **at least** once, most several times. Failing a drivers test doesn't make anyone stupid or bad or anything, the tests are made to be kinda hard to make sure we take driving seriously. Good luck, and if you fail again: ¯\ _ (ツ)_ /¯
In the long scheme of things, those issues won't matter. Whenever something starts to stress me out, I think... will this matter in 5 years? Usually, the answer is no. And I like the hair. I've never dyed mine, but the color is great
Hey, keep your chin up Lou. You got this. Exams aren't the end of the world. Do your best, and love the rest. Life throws us challenges sometimes, but they aren't what defines us. It's our ability to overcome them and stay true to our passion that makes us who we are. Try looking at jobs that you wouldn't normally consider. Believe in yourself, test yourself, and you'll find your way. 😁 Good luck.
I'm wishing you luck at all of those. Also, I'm really digging the blue hair
I see a strength in you. Hell, you’re braver than I for just putting your face in this community. All these things that are drilled into us as being important... the really important things don’t need that. We just know.
Extension of the title: I just feel so stressed right now.. I'm sorry if this isn't toast worthy but I had a breakdown today and an almost break down yesterday.. And I thought I could maybe need some kind words..
Thank you ❤️
Thank you so much.. this really helped ❤️
Thank you very much ❤️
I will try, thank you..
Thanks.. but its so much money per test.. almost 100$ (93€)
Thank you
It takes a lot more strength to continue and that’s something you should be proud of that you didn’t let it discourage you and most people would have just quit or given up but your persistent and that’s a valuable trait
Consider taking "try" out of your vocabulary. Trying gives us an excuse to fail. Instead maybe say "I will!" I support you 100%.
You're right.. I won't quit now
Wow, I never really thought about it that way, you're right! I will. I will stray strong
Exactly! Whenever someone says "I'll try to make it to the party" (or something similar) I guarantee you they ain't coming. Go get em OP!

Edit : my dad was the smartest man I knew. He was a renowned doctor in his field and even came up with certain surgical procedures. Never seen anything like it, and guess what? He failed his drivers test too!
❤️
you have courage to go into those lands
You’re beautiful! Your glasses are so good for your aesthetic and suit your face really well. You also have far more courage than me to go into roast me
I like your face
I don’t see anything to roast at all. I love your style and those glasses really compliment your attractiveness
i love the shape of your eyes, they’re perfect. you have the courage to express yourself through your style and fashion and that’s really cool when so many of us are under pressure to confirm. continue being you (:
I looked through your roast me post, and damn they didn't pull any punches. The fact that you still had the humility to leave it up on your profile and seeing your comments as you took each hit on the chin honestly makes me thin you're a lot stronger and more secure than you let on

I'm too young to post over there but even if I was I'm too much of a pussy to post there anyways, so kudos to you for being able to take multiple jokes on the chin. You should be  walking with your head held high
Cute jacket, cute hat, cut glasses, cute lipstick, cute face!! I love it! We’d be friends for sure in real life. Forget Roast Me, you’re a number one cutie!
You’re super duper cute! I love your lipstick choice it’s a great color on you.. I also think your glasses are really flattering! You’ve got more courage than I do to even try to post on roast me! I hope you have a great day! :)
No
You look great! You are right to post on roast me couse no one would believe you would need encouragement when you are that beautifull.
You're a creative human and very pretty. Smile and stay out of roast me. It's fun to comment in jest but they can take it too far some of them. They ate me alive. You're safe here. We're rooting for you!
The fact that you came from r/roastme makes you seem brave. Guess what's better? You're emotionally stable, being able to ask a similar group of people for help!
I like your style and you are very brave to expose for roasting
 you ever wonder if like, somewhere out there in space, there's another  planet exactly like ours, and like, another Reddit with people  in it exactly like us? Except they're like tacos, like, like taco  people? 

 Sexy, sexy tacos. And you would be the sexiest taco of them all!
You're a wonderful woman and an independent thinker who marches to the beat of your own drum.  I feel like when someone asks you your opinion on a topic, you offer a unique perspective that most people probably would not even consider.  Your companionship and your mind are truly invaluable gifts that couldn't be purchased with all of the money in the world.
Cute fashion sense, good taste in glasses, love your hair, adorable nose, warm and friendly eyes. You look like you'd be so much fun to hang out with.

Edit: Just checked the Roast Me post. So you're a creative type then? Confirmed, you definitely seem like you'd be fun to hang with.
Only r/RoastMe could possibly say a face that cute was anything but perfect just the way it is. You've got fashion, you've got looks, and you've got hope. Stay tough. You're doing great.
Seeking out insults is a form of self harm. You deserve much better than that. Please, take care of yourself, and surround yourself with people who support you. Also, I think you're really cute.
This may sound like an odd compliment, but your chin is absolutely adorable! (I focus on things that most people don’t!)
You are brave to post your picture in both places, the internet can be very unfriendly. I think you look like a fun person to hang out with, I'd totally be your friend. You're also adorable to boot. :)
Why would you go to r/roastme if you have minimal self-esteem?
actl love the vibes you're giving out no lie
You're cute. You kinda remind me of Nancy Wheeler from Stranger Things.
Curiosity killed the cat
Thank you my family hates my glasses and berates me on them constantly
I like you
Someone likes my style yay! I live in a conservative area where it's frowned upon
I'm super shy and socially anxious, so I express myself and my personality through my clothes. Thank you for your kind words
I love this comment so much, thanks a lot
Omg let's be friends yay
It's a Physician's Formula lipstick! I love it! Thank you so much, you have an awesome day ❤️
Yes
You should see what they had to say on roast me, I was burnt to a crisp
I'm rooting for you as well you're great
Emotionally stable hahaha the antidepressants are helping
You're great thank you
I love everything about this.
And tacos.
A lot of people say that I do! Thanks for saying that!
Thanks a lot! I guess you'd say I'm the creative type. I work at a theatre, I draw and paint on my free time (might start posting in art subreddits once I gain some confidence) and I love styling myself the way I do. Love this comment, thanks again
You are also doing great, stay cool
I take care of myself the best I can, I was mostly just intrigued what people would say I guess? I was made fun of growing up by those around me but wanted to know what the internet would say I guess
Thank you!
Thank you!!!!
Curiosity mostly
Thanks a lot!
Thank you! I never watched Stranger Things, is it worth the watch?
Don't think that way, grrr
You look amazing in them! Don’t listen to any negativity people give you <3
Plus those glasses on you 👌🏻
👭
Ok

U cute!
I just read it up and sure they try but cant really find anything so they complain about character wich isnt visible. I think thats a compliment in itself. Brave girl proud of you.
Here's a better representation of what people think. And I'm sorry that you got made fun of. I did too. It really sucks. Just know that that's their problem. You are awesome.
Have a wonderful day!
That’s like going to the liquor store when you have liver issues
Yes, definitely! It's a great show. You should watch it! It's basically The Goonies and Ghostbusters combined with a horror. I'm sure you'll dig it.
I'll try my best!
So are you my guy, have a good day
You too
You smile alot keep it up!  Stay happy man! IF you feel down remember the good times.
That smile! I adore your smile. I love the ones that light up your whole face and make me want to smile back at you. So here I am at work smiling back at your picture.
They’re right, that is one contagious smile. Looking good my man.
Love that smile, especially since it shows off your great teeth. You’ve got really good facial hair too. Keep hanging on in there!
Hang in there! You’re strong enough to go through a full year i’m sure you can take it further!
Your smile is nice and genuine.
What a great smile
That smile-beard combo looks really good my man, keep it up!!
you have an amazing smile and great skin, you’ll make it through to the otherside of discomfort and get the happiness you seek. just keep going
Ah man! Your friendly face makes me feel like everything is going to be ok. I’m sorry the year has been a struggle for you but you’re incredibly strong to keep it up with that smile on your face. Keep at it my friend! It’s up from here!
Wow, that's smile of the day for me mate! When I saw your photo I immediately smiled myself :D 

Anyone who can flash a smile like that, can get through the rest of the year with hope and positivity. I wish you both :)
You probably brightened someone’s day without even realizing it.
Your smile makes me happy :)

Whatever it is you're going through, I'm rooting for you to make it through it, I know you can do it!
This might be a weird compliment but you look so well-groomed?? You don't have a single hair out of place, your eyebrows look great, your skin is glowing and has the kind of dewy, just-moisturized look that's so popular, you have smooth lips and *really* nice, straight, clean teeth. 

You look like the kind of guy who knows what he's worth and takes care of himself, but isn't an asshole because he also takes care of the people around him. It's something about your eyes, they seem very kind and knowing, but also humble. 

You might be struggling so far this year, but I feel like you have good things ahead of you. I'm sure you're inspiring plenty of young men to take better care of themselves so I salute you for that (and thank you on behalf of their future romantic partners.)
Dang, bro. You have some GREAT teeth and the hairline is still solid
Amazing smile, perfectly groomed, but it's more than that. You just have such a pleasant face,you are wonderful to look at, I just want to give you a momma bear hug!
My man! 

&#x200B;

You look like such a cool dude...wanna hit the bars or play a game or whatever?

&#x200B;

You 100% legit look like an awesome hang-out buddy.
you would make a perfect model for an advert  (any product). with that amazing smile I'd buy  it!
Great smile, kind eyes, and sharp hair. You're set, my friend. Stay strong and keep moving forward.
You have the kind of energy that can cheer up everyone around you. Your smile makes other people smile.
Plenty of others have said it but you've got a killer smile bro. I hope the rest of the year gives you plenty of reason to share it with those around you.
This was so nice!  Thank you so much!!
Breakups are the worst, dude, so don't feel bad about feeling bad. Give yourself some time, you'll get through this.
Hey man, we grow with each relationship and usually they have to end to make us the human worthy of the one. Ofcourse now its a downer but you will grow with it for sure. ANd hey you look pretty good and fit you will have no trouble to find someone when you are ready.
it will get a lot worse before it gets better, but in time you'll see you can and deserve to love again!
you are very good looking!! 

See some friends, the world is full of possibilities!
You have stunning eyes! Cheer up! Something good is coming your way! ☀️
Sorry about the heartbreak, one of the worst feelings. You’re going to be ok and you’ll look back and be so grateful for the way things turn out. Plus you’re very handsome and I’m sure there are tons of people hoping to be your next date 🤗
   
Your eyes are magnificent. the world is full of possibilities for you
Really? I’ll take you in the blink of an eye. 😳 We might be a good match, as I look like the Britney of the 2000s, just a handful of years older 😇.
Jealous of your jawline and your tan. I just burn now...
It's your ex's loss. Seriously. Have you looked in the mirror? You won the genetic lottery.
I’m so sorry to hear about your relationship ending. You’re a wonderful looking dude with great potential WHEN YOURE READY. no rush at all. 🥂 here’s a toast to you, an attractive lifeguard who will swim against the current to calmer and clearer waters.
You look nice, I like your eyes. You'll have no trouble meeting someone.
Yikes. I'm sorry man. Breakups suck ass and it takes some time to recover. I don't really know how to help you but thank you for reaching out to this sub 💚
Cheer up. Go for a jog.
I’m a lifeguard so it’s really my job
You’re here. You’re fighting. You’re surviving. And that’s enough! Keep it up! Do something nice for yourself today!
You have pretty eyes, and such a cute nose!
I love your glasses! I hope your day gets better! Sending all the good vibes your way!
If you faked your smile here im done couse it looks honest to me. You should be happy no reason not to be. You might not play everyones game all the time but no one does.
Hey, you don't know me.. you don't have to believe me when I say "it will get better".. But i know it will.  You seem like such a sweet person.. And beautiful too. Especially your eyes, they look so lovely and kind ❤️ Please keep on fighting, it's worth every bit ✨
You're alive, fighting and it seems like you care to continue doing so. That's so much of the fight.
Your hairstyle is very nice!

And you look like a thriving person, keep on going!

Xoxo
It’s incredibly difficult but all of us here are rooting for you!! You’re beautiful, and your smile is so wonderful!! I hope your days just get better from here on out :)
Oh girl! You’re so cute! Your eyes are gorgeous and your face is so friendly. Sending you lots of love from across the ocean cutie 🌸
You are beautiful girl !!! I'm so happy you are here and proud of you for how far you've already come ❤️
Lovely eyes and cute nose. Your face looks very kind and inviting, I bet you can light up a room with your smile when you walk in. Keep fighting you got this, we’re all rooting for you. ❤️❤️❤️
Hey now. I've had too many friends go through eating disorders.... I'm truly sorry to hear it, and I hope you recover. And I like the glasses!
Aww, look at that smile! It warms my heart :) If this is you disheveled, you must be a real stunner when you're all dressed up. Thanks for sharing your smile with us! I know it can be hard to do when you're depressed, but you gave us one anyway, and it brought a smile to my face too!
Your appearance isn't what makes a difference. Your heart is. You have hope, you have a sense of optimism. Between those two, you can do whatever you want. Be strong, and fight to do good. You've got this. 💪
Hold on. The fact that you are even reaching out tells me that you are not ready to give up. Depression is a beast (I know from experience) but you can’t let it overtake you. 

You are beautiful. Even if you don’t feel like that now, I’m telling you that you are. 

All we have in life are a multitude of “temporary reprieves.” So you take those little somethings that you are getting in this thread and use them!

Let them bolster you up when you’re felling bogged down by life. I know that what I have to offer isn’t much, but I hope it gives you the fight to carry on.
Mental health can be a real bitch sometimes, but girl your beautiful self will annihilate these issues, just you wait and see! You’re stronger than you know!
You can do it! 
I may just be a random stranger, but I truly believe in you :)
And I will join many other people in saying: it does get better, even if it may take some time, it gets better

Also, your skin looks very smooth, and you do have a bright smile! 
You look lovely, and if this is your disheveled state , then that means that once it does get better you’ll only look lovelier
Your smile and your eyes are so beatiful!
You look great, I love your smile! Every single day of your life is a day you have lived through and won. There's nothing you can't do, and you're amazing. I have faith in you and know you're going to be ok. And that disheveled look - kinda cute.
Madam you're a lovely woman and a wonderful friend and companion with immense heart and soul.  Your best friend and your family are very lucky to have you and would undoubtedly be torn to pieces if heaven forbid you were to succumb to your eating disorder.  I'm so sorry for all that you're going through, but if you'd ever like a friend to talk about your troubles with, you can PM me.
I hope you get better soon. Also, You have really pretty eyes.
I'm gonna be honest. Your teeth is not ideal.

That's all. Literally that's everything bad I found on you. You really look great and I bet you are nice, too!
And about the teeth - NO ONE is ideal. Everyone has their weak sides, everyone, and honestly, the world has much more important problems than some teeth. There's nothing to feel bad about!
Your eyes are so pretty! Jealous!

I second this!
Seconded, I came here to say what an adorable nose you have!
Thank you :)
Thank you 😊
Thank you so much. That is so kind ❤️💕
Thank you very true!
Thank you!
Thank you that means a lot :)
Thank you 🌼

Thank you so much <3 ☺️
Thank you (:
Thank you 😊
It doesn't work like that lmao
I also agree on the nose. It's cute and very boopworthy. I wanna boop that nose.
No problem!!!! ♥️♥️♥️
I’ve never gotten so many comments on my nose (or any) let alone it being boopworthy haha 😂
bisexuals unite! i’m sure there are a lot of people who want you, you just don’t know it! 

also, yeah your hair looks good but so does your face OKAY
Man / Girl no matter what you can pull it off easy nice neutral looks for me, and stay positive and positivity will come back at some point! Good Luck!
Guess you could say you’re all bi yourself

Lmao hope that made you laugh. Nobody you’ve met so far is worthy! You’re really pretty so your looks are not the issue. Good things take time :) have a great day <3
You look AMAZING!!!😍😍😍
You are beautiful! Fuck what other people think and you do you. Don’t sweat the small stuff, keep your chin up.
You have gorgeous hair and a sweet, gentle looking face, I bet you are a really kind person as well. Those people that don't want you sure are missing out!
It’s not that no-one wants you, life just hasn’t found you the right person yet. Focus on loving your beautiful self and love from someone else will come! You’re throughly gorgeous, own it!
I would kill for your lips ugh
So many people coat themselves in makeup nowadays, you are naturally a gem! Keep doing you 👍
Hey, you look like a really nice person, keep that beautiful smile on your face. Also your hair are pretty.
I like your style- jean jackets are classic!

And it can take awhile to find the right person or even a good right-now person. Hang in there!
You have the look in your eyes of a loving soul.
Gorgeous! Hair, face, mouth, eyes, all of it! I’m sorry dating has been rough but you’re going to find the right person and they’re going to be so lucky to have you 💗
You have that excellent fresh look that can turn into wowza with some touch ups. Both are yours to claim. You have great features. Your hair is awesome-maybe a bit of conditioner to bring out its colors? Your peeps are out there. Keep that deep gaze and knowing smile going and the right persons will be swept away. You just haven’t met them yet.
You look like a model and I'm so jealous of that lol. Besides, who needs dating. Work towards your goals in your life and hopefully the right one will come by your side.
Props to being true to yourself! Anyone of any gender would be lucky to have you :)
I think you’re quite beautiful!
Good things come to those who wait... you'll be glad you waited when the right person comes along! I love your style. Your vibe is really cool, I can just tell! Try to stay positive!
You are very beautifu, I really love your eyes!
And try to thing positive maybe you doesn't find that person who are perfect for you
Have you seen your lips?

They're perfect
Today you managed AT LEAST 10 minutes of self care, and that's something to be proud of. Focus on liking yourself, and others will follow
Stay true to you.
One part? Hell no. You have gorgeous eyes. Your hair is great, so go get yourself a badass salon job, some fresh digs, and hit the town. Somebody will be head over heels for you in no time.
You have such beautiful features! Is your hair naturally curly by any chance? From a fellow curly haired bisexual
no lie you actually look great? Like you remind me of those really chiselled statues. Those people don't know what they're missing
Not sure what gender you are, but you’re beautiful and I’d like to meet you either way. I hope you can see yourself like you truly deserve to see yourself .
You are absolutely beautiful and have such a beautiful smile it would leave Mona lisa in envy!
Your hair looks great, your eyes are beautiful and you've got nice lips (I'm a bit jealous, if I'm being honest).  You're always welcome at my place. If you're ever in NC stop by for a cup of tea. 

And I'm sure your hair would've been just fine with only a minute of brushing.
Well there are few,  got grindr recently turns out im in older people type
I knew at least one person wont be sure of my gender, Its always funny and cheers me up! ^^
Just on Photo tho took around 60 of these Just to find one i look good at
They arę naturaly redish but i dont think they are prison sentance worth  : D
Sadly there is only one loving soul :P
Well they could use some conditioner i suppose,  also i cant look deep into eyes cuz i start getting shy as hell
I dont look like a model! Problably... i mean thats first time i hear IT and there were times when i was looking better :P
Not always true to myself depends on time and Day!
Thanks i bet You are too!
That is gay vibe im pretty sure.
Eyes are always pretty i belive!
See them every day pretty used to them. Prefer shorter ones.
Hope you don't get offended by this

But every guy that looks at you will want your lips either on his lips or his dick
Yes it is ^^
The mona lisa thing is so sweet thank you!
Well if i will have a reason to fly there why not ! 
And it would Look good for first 30 minutes they are just curly and are always a mess
I guessed you might go with male here but you could easily pull female off if you wanted to also you could easily empathise the male look even more. I guessed you  wanted it to be this way. hf and stay who you are!
No im telling you! You are beautiful! The hair😍 them eyebrows 🤑 that chin 😉  everything looks so pretty!
Try not to be so hard on yourself,coz all of you is speaking beautiful!🌹❤🌹
Well, I’d definitely want to hang with you. Keep that gorgeous head up
You have great hair. The colors are cool and conditioner brings them out. Why not,eh? I’m shy too. I never ever make eye contact. Scares me. Feels like I’m gut shot. But I think if you were taking in a sunset or wildlife or such, you would have a calm gaze that a person could sit with for hours. You have a deep and soothing look about you.
Trust me you look like one. If I was you, I'd definitely consider modeling or something.
Tomato tomato
It's more pretty when a person is happy
PM me if you ever want curly hair tips!!!!
Absolutely  :)
Was thinking about crossdressing on some anime con a bit to shy tho, Maybe next year!


Edit : also it wasnt a choice my beard just dont grow and is feel good in long hair
Well the head is usually down,  gotta look where you are going or you will fall
Wow i guess we are the same
Maybe someday for now i need to take care of my diet and fitness. Let set my chances as high as o can; P
I know i need to brush them after shower when they are wet and i need to use conditioner is there much more i should know?
Probably in more ways than this. There’s a place for us in this world. If you get a quiet moment, google Desidrata. It got me thru many insecure times.
So I actually don’t own a brush. I have a wide tooth comb I only use in the shower. I stopped using products with sulfates and parabens about a year and a half ago. Shea Moisture is a popular brand but it’s expensive and Cantu works just as well. After you get out of the shower (and you’ve shampooed and conditioned) then you can add product (lots of options. Gel, cream, mousse, etc.) and scrunch your curls and either diffuse them or let them air dry. I also use a scrub tee shirt and scrunch some of the moisture out. I want to be the kind of person that diffuses my hair but I’m lazy so I typically let it air dry. Additionally, I’ve gone from washing my hair every 2 days to once a week. Better for your hair and as a nice bonus it’s easier because curly hair is a lot of maintenance! 

Tl;dr: don’t use a brush or comb outside of the shower, use a tee shirt to scrunch your hair dry, try some curly hair products 

disclaimer: not an expert. just have curly hair
Oh i have other ways i always Think about poetry book im writing and my future doughter (hope, in polish it sounds 10 Times better )
I just feel like brush works better for me, i always leave my hair to dry. Never use t shirts or driers. Also since im a teenager and its hotele as hell i actually wash my hair everyday. Would like to work it out to like once every third day. Would be healthier for them i think.  

Also i dont use t shirts becouse i dont like my curly hair :P
Very deep ppl do poetry. It’s a gift from the universe. Something incredible to do. Writing poetry is like giving an organ or donating blood. It heals a person deep inside. Poetry is magic.
Fair enough! It’s whatever works best for you! It took me a very long time to embrace my curls. Best of luck on your journey!
First things first, try calling a suicide hotline. They really do help. Visually, theres nothing wrong with you. You have a good symmetrical face, and very clear skin, and nice thick hair. If you want, I can give you my personal number or discord and we can chat more. I'm free to be a friend if you need
Hey there, I’m going to keep this one a bit short as sometimes that can make a more lasting impression.

You **deserve** a well lived, long life. Whatever is making you feel this way, maybe be multiple things, leave it behind. You have the power to change your situation and start on a happier path.

All the best
In 10 years from now, you will be curled up on the couch with your spouse, listening tl the rain hit the roof and watching your children play. And you will think to yourself "Damn. Im so happy i stuck though the tough times...i made it :) "

Good luck brother, i believe in you
Hey! Have you tried heading over to r/suicidewatch ? Those guys are great. 

Secondly, I‘ve been where you are and it does get better. I know everyone says that and I didn’t believe it, but here I am. Two weeks into counseling and i wanted to die more than ever, but somehow I didn’t. Now I’m 5 months on anti-depressants (4months since they started working) and every day I marvel at something new I’m able to do it able to enjoy. Life does get better and you should experience it too. I know the world is better with you in it!
I tried to kill myself about five years ago. I thought I was helping everybody I loved by disappearing so I couldn’t be a burden. I couldn’t imagine that I had any value to anyone. After my suicide attempt, I was stunned when people told me that they needed me and how I was making a difference. Since then I have gone on to accomplish things I had not thought possible for me. I feel like a different person. I take my medication and I attended therapy, and I ask for help when I need it. I am not a remarkable person. The only thing that changed is that I let people help me and I won’t give up on myself. If you let people help you and you are kind to yourself (even if you don’t initially believe you deserve it), things will get better for you. It takes time to change your mindset, but you can do it. There are people who love you and need you. There will be people who will never be okay again if you die by suicide. People you might not suspect. I am grateful that I didn’t die before I had the chance to get better. You have that chance ahead of you too! Stay determined. Let someone give you a hug. You can do this!
7 days to die is a game on steam. Maybe play that and uhh don't die please. You have so much for ta live bud, don't violate your future
Just send me a message anytime and I’ll try to reply as soon as I can, most of my family is in Sweden so I’m use to that level of time difference haha
I’ve been exactly where you are right now before and trust me, it will get better. I know happiness seems unachievable at the moment but you just have to keep on going. Seeking help, no matter how small it is, is so brave and for that, I’m so proud of you. My advice to you is to find something, anything, that keeps you going. It could be a game or an animal or a person, but finding that thing is the key to making it through. I’ve noticed that a few others have given you suicide hotlines and honestly, they are so helpful. I’ve called them before and the people there are so nice and caring. If you don’t like to call, most countries also have text lines as an alternative. I really recommend doing something like that. Or you could even message me. I’m always here to talk. Please keep on going. I know it’s painful now, but it will get better for you :)
People  often think, If I fail, I will lose something very important - like  getting into a good college, working at a great company, getting a  promotion at work, making lots of money and so on. But learning from our  mistakes is one of the greatest tools for learning; it gives us  information on what we need to do differently to succeed in life.

I  went through a period of my life where I’d tell myself every day that I  hated myself. It got to a point where I’d be in a conversation with my  friends or family and my mind would be running and running,” I’d be  thinking about all the stupid things I’ve said in my life, or all the  time I have wasted and it would just race and race. I had no motivation  to do anything. I would cry and cry (sometimes just internally). I would  be angry at the smallest things, I would scream driving in my car or  yell at our innocent little dog. Just having to change and put on  clothes, I said, ‘I can’t do this, I can’t.

There’s a quote I read that explains it pretty well:

**‘I forget to love myself most days. But I keep trying. I keep trying. And that alone is a victory.’**

If you’ve never struggled with the art of loving yourself, you may not get it, but for others, it’s real.

***T*****rying** to love *YOU*  is a victory in itself, so I don’t give up. I am needed and my life  matters - even when it doesn’t feel like it. I look for the good things  and cling to them. Now, for me, it is a daily decision to make it (my  life) work. To seek out the parts of my day, week, month or year that  brings me a sense of peace.   Everyday is another hash mark on a  successful "*LIFE"* scoreboard. The scoreboard that means I have survived another day. I am here for my family and friends. **I am here.  I am here.**
I know that spot. It's hard. Really, really hard. You can pull out of it. I believe in you
You seem like a nice person and I am sorry that you have to go through this but if you feel like you have no reason at all why don't you create one? Set a reasonable goal then a big one, try to accomplish them, there's so much to see on this world, so many nice people to meet and talk, think about all the dishes you'll never get to taste or all the places you'll never get to see if you give up now. I know it's hard, I know you think there's nothing else that will make you want to continue living but there is! It's you. You're worth the effort, you're worth the try. Don't try to please others, don't act like someone you're not, get out there and get some professional help. Let people who are trained to help do their job, it's okay to be vulnerable, it's okay to take some time for yourself and it sure is okay to ask for help. Coming to us was a good start now take a second step and please see a professional, try it for yourself, for all the people you never met but would like to meet, for us.
You need to let the people around you In, on this bro. Causing others more pain happens when we don't speak up. You're already so Incredibly brave, for posting this! Follow through, by coming out the other side stronger. Think how many people you can save, once you have saved yourself? Millions feel the same way as you do, right now. You're never alone. Going to counselling already makes you a success; Owning you problems and dealing with them. It ALWAYS gets worse before It gets better, when counselling/therapy begins. The sessions WILL get more positive, In time. Keep your chin up, legend In the making!! X
Please don’t do that. This too shall pass. Things won’t always feel this hopeless. Trust me. I’ve been there
I'm toasting you for posting this. THANK GOODNESS you are reaching out, crying out for help. That is your soul telling you that there IS something to live for. It is hard to see now, I can only imagine the pain you are feeling, but the picture I see in front of me is a bright young, beautiful human who DESERVES to be on this Earth. The world is a better place with you in it.
First off, I’m proud of you for seeking help. It’s a great act of courage to put yourself out there when your mental health makes you feel like there’s no reason to keep going. Secondly, something that helped me a lot when I was in your same position was reading a post that said “any reason to live is good reason to live”. Literally anything that makes you feel good, or happy, or content, or something that you enjoy- live for that. Cheesy movies? That’s a good reason. Eating your favorite food? That’s a good reason too. Finding small things to hold on to can keep you anchored, as well as serving as a respite from the way you feel. 
I encourage you to keep reaching out. If you want to talk, I’m always here to listen. Suicide and crisis hotlines are a great resource, but if you don’t like talking, i suggest the text based crisis service ImAlive. They’ve helped me a lot too. 
You have a valuable place in the world, and you deserve to feel okay, if not happy. We’ll all be rooting for you.
You are not alone. Things will get better. Please hold on.
Hey so I read a bit through your post history and saw that you had a girlfriend? Are you still together? Maybe you could try and open up to her a bit more. I'm sure she'd want you to. I know the world can seem unbearable at times, but you are only 16. I know you don't need to be reminded of it but you are so young!! SO young!! You have your whole entire life ahead of you! You still need to grow up, become a man, a husband, a father, even a grandfather! You can't give up now when there's still the rest of your life to build! When you feel so down you think you can't continue, give yourself 10 years. Because in 10 years time, whatever shitty thing is happening in your life right now won't matter! It will become insignificant, or time will make it less painful. So give yourself 10 years. And talk to people! Talk about your feelings, your emotions, what's bothering you...because it helps to open up. Doesn't matter to who, just keep reaching out to people and you'll find that it always helps. So don't give up okay? Keep on living!
I had my own set date 4 years ago. I had just turned 18, here I am at 22 writing to you after I got help. I want you to know you have so much to live for, I thought that I didn't either. I was basically failing high school but now I've graduated from my trade with a certificate in medical assistance, I'm helping people, I'm in love with life. All of us are begging you to please help yourself get the love, help and support you need. You need to heal in order to go on, and then you can fall in love with living again. We want you to reach out. Your life is precious. You are precious. ❤
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicide_crisis_lines

I don’t know what country you’re in, but here’s a link to suicide crisis resources by country. In the US you can text the word “connect” to 741741 to use the crisis text line.  I just needed to add this info since I didn’t include it in my original response.
You have so much more to offer than what your mind is telling you.   The overwhelming feeling will pass.  I truly believe you are capable of pushing through this.   Posting this shows the strength inside you.  Take the next step get some help.  You are not alone in the way you feel and you don't have to go through this alone.
You matter! feel free to PM me to chat about anything and everything you want to. I know how dark and hopeless things can seem sometimes but please listen to everyone in this thread. You took the first step, asking for help and acknowledging your feelings. One day at a time my friend, things will get better!
Taking your life won’t take away the pain but pass it onto someone else. The window screen of a car is bigger than the rear view mirror because what’s in front of you is more important than what’s behind you. Just remember even the brightest stars need darkness to shine. God bless Brother
Feel free to pm me if you want to vent, you don’t know me but I’m a very good listener and I’m a nurse. Emotions are really tricky, I had issues that I had to deal with from early in my life and a counselor helped a lot but time was the biggest factor in healing. No one could really fix how I felt except me. Coming to terms with issues and recognizing them takes time so don’t expect results anytime soon but they will come. School is another thing. When I first attended a university I dropped out after not even a year and worked for a year and then went back to school for something else. Was it the right thing to do? Who knows, I’m where I’m at today because of that decision so all that matters is where I’m at now. Changes can be sudden and then they can be really slow. The best thing you can do is focus on each of the little changes and see those as progress, before you know it you will be further ahead than you realized 😁
hey man you are young and you feel its justified to give up, but reconsider that time will pass faster after every day and we dont have much time anyway. Do ANything, something that matters. Try help others or yourself. You can do it!
I feel you. You are not alone here. The most important thing is to get through one day, everyday. Keep holding on my friend.
Friend you can continue living a full long beautiful life. This is a dark time for you but I and others can assure you that it will get better. We promise it will.
You look like you have plenty to offer to yourself and those around you. Think you can change the world for the better. I think you can turn it all around and use this tough time to help others who are in your shoes. You can do this! Don’t let this be the end, you have a lot to offer!
I was in the same exact situation as you bro, up until 4 months ago....Out of nowhere I met the girl of my dreams, started to feel happier, feel like I have a purpose....You wont ever know when it's going to happen but PLEASE believe me in the fact that it WILL happen ok?...You will be SO SO happy that you were strong enough to make it. You look tough as shit my guy, stick it out for all of us who have been were you are....Life is fucking weird but it always works out. Had house fires where I lost everything physical, had heart breaks that robbed me of everything mental but life will always balance it out in time. You just have to wait...be strong and wait. Love you bro!
First of all:love your hair and i bet you have a awesome smile

I could give you 100 reasons to live,not kidding 100 REASONS,but i want first to say,tri talking to a suicide hotline they really help 

My best friend killed herself and i still cry everyday so much and i feel so sad all time

Is painful to know what you are going trough,but please we will miss you and is not worth it

We love you okay?<3 try a suicide hotline,they will help
Dude you got this. When people say it gets better, it really does. It goes up and down, and has good/bad on the way, but over all it DOES get better.

Worst years of my life were teens through to early 30s - now mid 40s and life is fucking awesome.  


hang in there for me mate!
Hey, you're awesome. I get your whole face just lights right up when you smile.


That said, every day you wake up and climb out of bed is already a victory. You can do this.
[deleted]
This too shall pass. If you need a friend I’m here!
You have to allow time for things to get better and they will. You don't know the potential for happiness that you actually have because you haven't given yourself the chance. If you have only been in counseling for 2 weeks give it a couple more weeks before you do anything too drastic. You got this! I believe in you.
I know how hard it is. But I promise you it can get better. You have the potential to make other people's lives better. Please rethink.
I know that this world can get hard and dark, but you got this! You don't have to be okay, you don't have to be strong, and it's okay to feel like shit-- as long as you rise again. I've been there before, so many people have... just remember that you are not alone!
Actually, You're emotionally stable, being able to ask the internet for help!

The internet is a place full of depression and dark humor. Personally, I like it, because my emotions are complex too.


Maybe you should take a break, talk to your family, then maybe change your mind?
I like your haircut, it looks great on you.
Hang in there, it’d be a real shame
You matter & I promise that it gets better. You’ve gotta stick around to find out-
you are an incredibly strong person. battling suicidal thoughts takes an incredible amount of courage. my pms are always open. keep fighting, tomorrow needs you ❤️
The fact that you're here sharing this at all means you're brave enough not to suffer in silence. That alone is a reason to toast yourself-not everyone has the courage to admit when they're struggling. 

I glanced at your post history (hope you don't mind), and it looks like you've recently been rejected by a girl. Toast yourself for putting yourself out there in the first place-a lot of kids your age (I'm assuming you're pretty young) don't have the guts to ask out people they have a crush on at all. Please don't lose that willingness to try again in the future: in my experience, people who are up front about their feelings and who are willing to approach people they like are the happiest in relationships later in life, in part because they've learned from rejections. 

You're brave-can you use that bravery to get professional help?
/u/ashmit50042 Hey dude I hope you see this,  I just wanted to let you know that you’ve got a friend in California rooting for you. Also from your comments you seem like a super cool dude, and I noticed you’re active on this sub, leaving toasts for other people that need it :) You also clearly care quite deeply about your family and friends. Very cool stuff my dude, despite the darkness you’re going through.

I don’t have any advice per se, but I wanted to toss you the idea that sharing your problems with a friend is often actually a huge compliment to that person because you are telling them by your actions that you trust and respect them enough to share your deepest shit with them. Whenever a friend has shared difficult issues with me or even broken down crying over something very painful, I have never felt burdened - only a deep LOVE for them, increased closeness to them, and a desire to be there for them in whatever way will help most! If you think back to the times your friends have opened up to you about real shit, I sincerely doubt you thought any less of them for opening up to you and probably if anything the opposite. Believe your friends when they say they care about you - they mean it! And if you give them a chance I’m sure they will prove it :)

Of course for some people this ^^^ is definitely NOT the case, but that is down to one’s friends ... That would suck, but if it turns out your friends are truly uncaring people there’s no time like the present to find that out and replace them with way better ones :D I hope tomorrow is decent for you my dude, please reach out any time 👊🏻
This will get better, it simply has to! I promise, when things are at their worst, somethings got to give, and that means things do change and get better. 
You’re young, and this sense of despair is far more common than anyone realises. You will get through this. And what’s more you’ll be a stronger better person for it.
I don’t know you but I do know that you have a lot to offer the world. Things WILL get better. You can overcome what you’re  going through and I promise things will turn up. Read the comments to your post, there are so many people rooting for you, offering support and wishing the best for you. Whenever you’re feeling down, reach out to your loved ones or even some of your Reddit supporters here :) don’t give up!
Hey friend you have lots and lots and lots of support. Please instead of doing anything message anyone who commented something kind and they’ll help you through. Try to set a therapy date if you can. You can get through this even though it doesn’t feel like that. Lots of people (me included) have felt the same but have found the right treatment to finally feel mentally healthy. Sending lots of love/thoughts/prayers
Please don’t do that, you’re giving out a call for help which means you do want to get better. It may seem like you’ve hit rock bottom but that just means it can only get better from here. You are loved, that’s a reason to live. Think of what a better future you’ll make for yourself because there’s always hope. It’ll be difficult but you are strong enough to overcome this.
Reach out to me anytime my dude. You seem soulful and full of potential. One day, you're gonna be important to even more people than you know. Message me anytime man.
Stay strong dude! We support you!!!❤️
Hello! 
Two semesters ago, i was on the verge of killing myself, i even planned it out and wrote a letter for my friends and family. 
But you know what? i’m so glad that i stuck through and did not proceed, no matter how much you plan it, its never a good plan, ever.
I have received love from not only the good people that surround me, but even from inanimate subjects in my life. i simply find joy in the simplest things now. Don’t give up just yet, there’s a lot you could look forward to!! goodluck on this amazing (but very hard) journey that is life, keep going, you got this.
Go to r/suicidewatch
Please don’t. You are one of a kind, believe it or not. You impact others lives in a unique way. Those memories you made with friends and family members will never have same impact or feeling if done with others. You bring such unique energy into the lives of those you have met. Be that person you wanted to save you. I know how that feels to have the feeling of not wanting to be here anymore. Continue to get help, realize that it’s not going to be easy peachy, and that’s it okay to feel sad. See today as a step to a new you, new life. You are in charge and if you want a fresh new cycle today, you can. You can do it! I believe in you. It makes me really upset that you happened to feel that way, but please don’t give up!
There are so many people here who have said so many things better than I ever could, I just want to send you some love. I have sons your age and your sadness affects me deeply. If I could show you how wonderful your life could be and keep you from this permanent end, I would. Love to you, and I wish for you a long life of health and happiness.
I know you can't see it, but there *is* a light at the end of the tunnel. I have been in the loony bin my fair share of times and depression is something I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. I may get downvoted into oblivion for suggesting it, but does where you live have a psychiatric ward or hospital? Honestly, as much as inpatient treatment sucks, getting admitted the first time saved my life. Since you're suicidal you need to call the suicide hotline or go to a hospital. I am sending all of my love to you. You rock, and you have survived all of your worst days so far, keep surviving. Please! Feel free to PM me. If nothing else I can offer a listening ear. Sending love to you :)
I’m rooting for you to keep going! I can’t imagine how much pain you are feeling, but I promise that if you ask for help and are patient, the pain can be managed and you can be happy to keep living. 

You are a wonderful, special person who is loved.
You look cool.
Don’t do it man, I know everyone says it but you can get to a happier place in your life. My DMs are open if you ever need to talk bro, I’m here.
It will get better
Hey, even if you don’t see it—you make the world a better place. Even if you feel like no one would notice/care if you died, you are NEEDED, you are WANTED, you are LOVED.

I know sometimes life seems like a giant mountain and you’re already exhausted, but all you need to do is put one foot in front of the other. Don’t think about your entire life at once, just take one day at a time.

You have so much to offer the world, and the world has so much to offer you. 

We all love you so much, man.
Listen here my friend, I've been there. I know how it feels. The hours long stares at the ceiling. The empty feeling. Not being able to hold back your tears or just feeling so deeply tired you cannot cry at all. Not being able to see any escape or any chance of it getting somewhat bearable.

But you what? I got better. I got help. I don't think of committing suicide anymore so, PLEASE, don't give up. Not for me or anyone else, for yourself. Talk to someone you trust, seek professional help, write down how you're feeling, anything. Take small steps and slowly pave your road to recovery. If the loser over here did it, so can you. I know you've heard this a lot before, but it does get better at some point and it will be worth it, I also didn't believe that, but it really does. Hope to hear from you 8 days from now :)
I believe in you. I know that you are strong as well. Believe in yourself and you can get through even your darkest days. You are a lot stronger than you think! I know how it feels to feel like you have nothing left, but trust me... you have a million reasons to stay and keep living. Think about everything that makes you happy, and surround yourself with those things. I know it’s easier said than done, but life truly does get better with time, and time does heal all wounds. If you ever need someone to talk to, please message me anytime! I’m always here to listen🌸 sending love and light to you, and I promise that things will get better! I believe in you!
I'm so sorry that you're in this place right now, but please know that a lot of people have been where you are, myself included, and have made it through and it does get better. That might sound like bullshit right now, and it might sound the same way in seven days, but the fact that you're asking for help says some part of you wants to live and the day will come when that's the biggest, loudest part of you.

Also, please call a suicide hotline. I called when I was at that point, and I really wasn't expecting it to change anything but it saved my life and actually made my outlook a little better, enough to keep building on and get well.
You look just like my childhood best friend, and this post has taken me back to good times we had. Just looking at you, one can tell you’re a good dude. The world is a better place with you in it, and I hope you can come to love yourself, the world, and find your right place in it.
Which part of India are you from? I'm from Hyderabad! If you live anywhere close by.. please do hmu and we could go out and grab a drink and talk it out.
Hey if you ever need anyone to talk to let me know, you can always send me a chat or I can give you my discord.
I can't say much about your life, other than it has value. Every good thing you do makes your life worth living. Every person you can help, every charity you can benefit. You can do a lot of good in this world. 

Maybe you do hate your life. Maybe you're unhappy. But you can do the simplest things, and you can make that struggle easier for a thousand people. 

I changed hundreds of windows in an apartment complex by myself. The work was hard, and tiring, and lonely. I got cut, bled, cleaned for hours, and I was fairly miserable. But one day I started to notice that kids were looking out of the windows I was putting in, huge smiles on their faces. I realized it was because they couldn't see out of the old, worthless glass that was there before. It changed their world. Adults, too. People who felt trapped and alone could now look out at the world, and find hope for the future. 

You have a purpose. You have value. You can change lives. And you might just find that in doing so, you'll change your own. You just have to find out what it is you can do. Good luck, my friend. Stay strong.
I lost a friend to suicide a few months ago. Even though it may be hard to see there are people who will miss you. My friend felt alone even though so many people came to his funeral and miss him every day. You are not alone and there are people who love you. Things will get better please give them time
You are young, attractive, look pretty healthy, and life has so many twists and turns. Instead of dying in 7 days, make a life change, a drastic ALIVE one. Something that is scary, but a different kind of scary than you are dealing with now. If it doesn't work out, well, at least you aren't dead. If that doesn't work out you are stuck. 

Maybe sell off what you can and move somewhere new. Go get some job that doesn't have anything to do with what your future is "supposed" to be. Buy a train ticket to a place you can't pronounce and promise yourself to talk to 10 new people. 

And then also get some professional help. You need meds and talk therapy. It can help. May as well give it a try, first, anyhow!
Just know that it gets better.  Today might be bad.  Tomorrow might be worse.  next week will be better than the last two and the week after, better than that.

I speak from experience.  Keep up with the counseling as it does help.  They also have anonymous text lines you can utilize.
You have lots to live for. Just start with the small things you are unhappy with then the big things will come!
Oh!, you look so much like my son! (Handsome and very intelligent!) Please talk to someone about your real feelings, people do care!!!
Just checked this guy's profile just to be sure. You might all call me a sick fuck if I'm wrong, but this guy is karma farming. 

Now onto your case if you really are struggling with everything. Please as mentioned earlier, call a suicide hotline. They're no joke, they help. Do something to clear your mind, start singing, dancing, writing and things such as painting. Find yourself a hobby that you enjoy. Also, feel free to pm me if something if you wanna talk. You're a good looking dude, so don't worry about your looks man.
Hey bud, it's gonna be rough getting through this, but I can promise you that suicide will never end any suffering, especially if you survive the attempt. I'm a suicide survivor, and I can promise that there are better things out there.
Do you want to talk about what's going on that is making you plan this out?
I don't want you to die man, even though I'm an internet stranger, I know some of the feelings and how horrible it can be to lose your will to live.
I'm sending love across the Net.
I’ve been where you are and still struggle a lot .  Do not do it though. 
There’s a study that most survivors of suicide end up regretting jumping or taking the pills as soon as they do it. It’s an impulsive act. 
I’m not saying tor life with get a hundred percent better but you will have up and downs like everyone else. 
Fuck it, live your life to the fullest because it can only go up from here.
hey, pm me if you need someone who will send you memes and distract you from the sufferings of life. that’s how i got through my darkest hours. you’re physically very cute, i especially like your nose and hair. but emotionally you should seriously call a suicide hotline. they’re really helpful. sorry if this is a bit all over the place. just know i’m here for u
Please, don't. Even if it seems like there's nothing, now, there may be something later. I hope you can be happy at some point. I don't know how to help you, but I'm definitely willing to listen.
I don't even need to know you to know that you belong here with us, stick around for a while, if you ever need a friend... you know where we are! I love this page, so a toast to you! Stay strong 🙌
I self-harmed the other day and texted 741741. The person I talked to was really nice. I love you. Get well. ❤
Here are so many really good and positiv answers and I really can't say anything as smart like them, but I wish you all the best in the world! 

Everybody in this world has problems, some more and some less and everyone is just "fighting" through the days, because it's worth it! 

Nobody should die this young my friend. 
I lost my father when I was a little boy and it really really "screwed me up" and I'm depressed on many days but I'm always happy to be alive. 
Your Familie and friends wouldn't be the same after this and always wonder "why and why he didn't speak to us and why couldn't we help him". 

There are so many beautiful places to visit, so many nice peoples to meet and so many things to discover before we die. 

You will have a beautiful life, but you really have to keep going! Every days brings new possibilities! 

I believe in you and I bet very many people do it too!
Please please please, seek some help if you can, and if you can’t, please remember you’re much stronger than you might think you are right now. I’ve had depression my whole life, and thought about suicide more often than not, but every day I wake up I try to value as much as I can. I know it’s a cliché to say it gets better, but clichés are clichés for a reason. Pm if you wanna talk, I would love to get to meet someone as seemingly wonderful as yourself!
Personally, crisis hotlines weren't very helpful for me, given my circumstances but I truly hope they can help for you. Always remember that nobody has ever lived your life and never will, they don't control your emotions. Only you can really help yourself. Feel free to message me, I've did myself out of the worst suicidal pit and have been out for a few months!
Don’t do it, no one wants you gone, things’ll get better and you’ll be able to look back on this, good luck <3
Your good looking for one thing.
My heart goes out to you. 

When I was at my worst, I held on because of the people that (for whatever reason) cared for me. Thinking of those kinds of people/creatures in your life might help, but each person is different. 

There is a book that I've found helpful, it's called "The Reality Slap" by Russ Harris.

The point of the book is to help you get change the things that can change, and accept the things you can't. It's not about being a little ray of sunshine, but having peace regardless of what else is going on.

I hope that you find the determination to keep going, for whatever reason helps you keep moving forward even if it's a baby step a day. Please take strength in knowing that there are many people who have been where you are, so you aren't alone in your pain.
Hey man. Right out the gate, you’ve got some good looking hair. But, I know things are tough right now. But you’ll get through this. Life will get better and you’ll look back on this in the future. Definitely take advantage of the resources other people have shared. 

I wish you the best from the bottom of my heart. I believe in you man.
You're very brave, man. I know it must seem really bleak and scary now, but you've made it this far already. You've pulled through so much, and you're very resilient. Please listen to these people's words of encouragement. You mean a lot to all of us. Please take care, man. We're all here for you.
Please don’t. I’ve been in your shoes. I was in your position about 5 years ago. I hit rock bottom and was ready to give up...and then somehow, life just started to work in my favor. I am now healthy and loving my life and the people in it. Trust me when I say it gets better. Once you hit rock bottom, there’s nowhere else to go but up.
You are loved! You are treasured by your Heavenly Father...please don't cut your life short. The world needs unique YOU!
Bruh, it's stupid to give up now.  Suicide survivors have said that as soon as they jump or anything of the sort they immediately regret it and go on to better lives.  Dont leave living to chance, just skip that and try to realize how astronomically unlikely it is you are alive at all and try to enjoy that for as long as you can
How boring to never know what your life journey was. You may have a lot ahead of you, and you would write it off and throw it away before fruition. Life is a game, play it how you want. I hope things get better for you.
Please please don’t do it. I’ve attempted suicide about 12 times and been hospitalised so many times etc- I’ve also lost people to suicide and to see the looks on their loved ones faces.... just please. Please don’t.
It never seems like it’ll change, but I promise you that things can and will get better. You did the brave and right thing by speaking out, I’m here if you need to talk!
Please don’t die. The world will be worse off without you in it.

Hey thanks man. I've never really had body issues (yay) and I've been going to counseling for the past 2 weeks now. I'll def hit you up when I really need it. Thanks for your offer
Always avoided the hotline even after multiple suicidal episodes until one day I was about to do the deed and figured I’d see what they have to say before I go. I know it’s because they are trained to but they know EXACTLY all the right things to say. The things friends and family won’t know to say to you. Things you’ve been dying to hear whether you knew it or not. Whatever issue you are having they will provide solutions for it as well including giving you links and numbers to call.
[removed]
Damn that put good images in my head!
This can be so true. I was thinking about my past depression at high school/uni yesterday (10+ years), and am so extremely glad that I put through all those years. I am now happy, living together with my superawesome SO, and I left all those dark times behind me. Of couse some periods are rough, but thats ok now. Think about this, you have so much time for it to get better still. Please put through, although it can take time, better times will come for you too I’m sure.
What he says is absolutely 100% true, this may be the tough part but you just got to keep going, you can beat this!
Thank you for staying alive.
Ok thanks. I'll drop a line when I need it the most. Thanks a lot for your help
I had a a long term goal with my life that I was hoping would give me the motivation to power through school after which I would have the time and concentration to work on it. But now I'm just feeling like it's not nearly enough, and an old (potentially life-threatening) medical issue I had a while back is resurfacing, so it almost feels like I'm meant to die young even if I don't off myself.

I might consider texting a suicide service, but I don't see how I can bring myself to open up to a complete stranger if I can't tell my closest and most trusted friends. They all know something's up with me but I can't bring myself to dump my problems on them when they've got their own shit to deal with (and believe me, they're going through some worse shit then me)
Thanks for the positive message dude. I def hope it gets better sometime

OP, please listen to this advice right here. The world will be a lesser place without you!
Haha thanks. It never really was body issues (that pimples have been good to me so far is one of the few things I feel blessed about) 

My main issue has been just compartmentalizing my emotions to the point where I cannot open up to my closest friends, let alone a stranger. Also I don't feel satisfied or engaged by what I'm doing in school rn. I thought I'd just finish school and follow my passions after that, but I feel my resolve fading.

I've been going to counseling for the past few weeks now and I'm trying to get my life back on track but it's been hard and I haven't felt any significant improvement so..... yeah.
You're evil.
Okay man, but seriously, know that even if I'm someone you've never met, you still matter to me. I dont care if I dont know you personally, itd still hurt to have you die. Please do message me if you want to converse.
I’m glad to hear you are seeing a counselor. That’s honestly the bravest, strongest thing you can do. Life can be hard, but it is absolutely worth living. Speak to a suicide hotline. Tell your counselor exactly what you’re feeling and what you told us. Your life is worth living.
I'll send you my number too man! I'm a good conversationalist.
Yeah,I'm not even sad or anything but that put a warm feeling in my stomach
Exactly. I went through the same thing as him. Yet here i am a few years later cuddling with my gf playing fortnite lol
Aww, thanks! I’ve had some help along the way. 😄
No problem! Stay positive 😁
DUDE. I had the same mindset (I’m gonna keep all my problems to myself because I don’t want to inconvenience my friends) but eventually my friend told me that me not opening up to her felt way worse than dumping my shit on her because she was worried and she took it as a sign that I could not trust her enough. Think about it. If your close friend was suicidal, you would want them to talk to you than not. Being there for each other’s lows, that’s what friends are for man. It’s not a competition of who has it worse. They care about you and love you man. Please talk to them. You’re not a burden or inconvenience, you might think that way but those are thoughts, not facts. People are willing to help and support you but they won’t know unless you reach out.
Use it for your own advantage them being strangers, they can't and won't judge you after all they barely know you. If you put your best in it, it's bound to happen, it might take more time than you anticipated but it will come true because you work on it. Having friends with similiar issues can actually help all of you, you can motivate each other, encourage each other, get help together and get over it together. For the medical issue I just hope the treatment works out, don't delay getting one. You'll never know unless you try man you just have to try, we can't know when our life will end but we can make the most of it.
Couple things. First off, helping you will help your friends feel better too. So let them help. Second, they would much rather spend some time helping you than have you dead. Trust me. Spend some time over on r/suicidebereavement if you wanna k ow what the aftermath is like. (Please don't post suicidal ideation over there though,  that's a trigger.)
Sometimes talking to a complete stranger is liberating. You can say anything, and they don't have any context by which to judge you. There are no consequences. You just hang up and go about your business, and you don't have to run into them the next day. 

&#x200B;

PM me. You don't have to wait until you "need it most". I'll give you my cell if you'd like, and we can just talk about stuff.
It really will! Seriously, counselling suuucks at 1st because you're reliving all the bullshit. Once you got that out of the way, It's time to heal and move on. You're almost at the next stage dude, hang In there ✌
Idk what happened to my reddit but it showed my comment a few times and then I deleted it for lack of confusion and now I don’t know what’s going on lol I did reply somewhere haha
I hope you don’t feel that way because of your perception of your looks(which is a lot of people and that’s why I say that). You look completely fine to me. I genuinely hope you aren’t serious about following through. Life is rough sometimes and it can even seem like the bad won’t end but there are lots of positive things to look at. Wherever you live please try to get some help (hotline, local support group, etc.). I’ve dealt with my share of really rough times the last year and not going to lie I felt like I wanted it all to end but I didn’t do any of it. It’s got better. Find a balance and find a support group that can bring the positive sides to you. You are loved even if you don’t always feel it 😊
Thanks for your offer. I'll definitely keep you in mind when I need someone to ping
Yeah I went for treatment like a few years back for it. Luckily we caught the problem before it got too serious so I was just put on medication and given an emergency pill to take if the problem ever flared up all of a sudden. I quit the medication because on Doc's recommendation but it's coming back. Will def head for another checkup.

I'll take a little bit of hope from your message and carry it on now. Maybe I might pull through who knows
Yeah I got the reply. I may actually try pinging you once. Maybe if you tell me which time zone you live in I could work something out
Please do. The world is better with you in it.
I’m on the West coast if the US now
Oof I'm in India. It could mean well over 9 hours of difference between us. Let's see what works for you and I'll check if I can make it work
Depression sucks dude I’m sorry. I’m the same age as you and working with the elderly lately has taught me that we’re really young and have so much time to figure out what we want to do. I’ve dropped out of two programs so far and do I feel like a guilty failure sometimes too? Yes I do, but realizing that something isn’t for you or needing to take a break from something when you don’t have the energy to get through it doesn’t make you a failure. As for the handsome thing - depression can warp our view of ourselves and make us see ourselves through an “ugly” lens when in reality (and ESPECIALLY) in your case - we are very good looking and deserve to look in the mirror and see the most attractive face in the universe!
You look like a super stylish guy! Don’t let depression get in the way of your dreams and passions!
As an unbiased stranger I can say that no way are you miles from being handsome, you are a handsome guy for sure. I’ve been in a similar situation myself recently and as someone who’s on the road to recovery I can tell you that it does get easier and you are stronger than you know. Hope this helps and you’re having a great day!
Hey dude you ever look at someone that doubts their ability or looks and you think to yourself - what are they talking about, they are so talented or handsome?!? That’s where I’m at with your post. Depression is messing with you and your ability to see it but from the outside looking in, as a guy who gains nothing by saying this to you - you are a handsome guy. That beard, your facial structure, the eyes. You aren’t lacking at all in the handsome department. Build some confidence back up and ladies watch out!

You have a good way with words too that not every one has, take a break but don’t give up the creative writing just yet. There’s a spark of something there and I honestly believe in your ability.

One last thing, you post some genuine comments on this sub for other people when they are down which shows you to be a caring and genuine person. Even with your ups and downs you find some time to be a positive moment in other peoples lives and I love you for that. The world needs more people like you. Hang in there, work through this bout and bounce back even stronger
Mate, I just want to join the people telling you that you're handsome. You are legitimately fit as*. 

Depression has been kicking my arse recently as well. I hope you're getting the help you need i.e. medication/therapy or at least thinking about it.

Hang on mate. You have so much to offer to the world :) xx
You look like a genuinely good person.
You look great and thanks for the comments you are doing a great job and we need more of your kind on this planet!

Have a great Day!
happy belated born day! you’re handsome, and your eyes are very kind even while they hold the weight of everything you’re going through. give yourself some of the kindness you give others and some of the grace you deserve too. you need some respite right now and that’s okay. sending you lots of love ❤️
Handsome man! Thank you for commenting to help others even when you’ve been feeling down - it says so much about someone. I’ve changed career directions too many times to count and I’m still here and I’m still learning and I’m happy for every decision. You’ll find what works for you! Be kind to yourself, and while you work on that just bask in the kindness of us.
Woah dude, I’m a girl and I think you are incredibly attractive- not just saying that to make you feel better, it’s true. You also have such a kind looking face and look very friendly and approachable.
Depression sucks so much... it really does a great job of making you feel worthless. I promise you’re not a failure. You’re a really handsome guy! I bet you have a great sense of humor too! It’s so hard to try to find enjoyment in things when depression has ahold of you. I hope you find happiness and purpose soon! If you ever need anyone to chat with or a friend to listen I’m always down to talk! I hope you have a fantastic week friend!
Hey, you are very handsome!!! I know as a man in the world we live in today it is harder to express any emotion or hardship. Thank you for sharing your struggle with depression. And thank you for fighting your fight. Remember that depression is a lying monster and the negative things that you think about yourself are not true. Keep fighting and much love to you ❤️❤️❤️
Miles from being ha- what the fuck? No man. You look like smooth blues with a side of whiskey. The fact that you're a writer is just another layer of kick-ass on the cake you're taking. Look for new things, they're not in short supply. You're set, my friend. Stay strong 💪 We need you out here.
You are miles from being handsome. Precisely, 0 miles. You're already there. You look awesome. I hope you can feel awesome someday too.
Happy belated birthday!! 
Depression is a b*tch my dude so I hope you have a good support system or a therapist you can talk to. I'm proud of you for reaching out for a toast! For people who like to give it can be hard to realise when you need to fill your own cup. 

Depression can make it hard to find joy in things that used to make you happy. Even in the bad days, there are short moments of goodness. They might be short, fleeting moments, but it's important to seek them out and try to hold onto them. Giving up on your interests even if you don't feel the same passion can make it harder to pull yourself out of a bad place. This isn't meant to sound preachy, but please don't give up on what makes you happy.

On a superficial note, I think you're very handsome. You have nice clear skin, you have really beautiful eyes, and you have nice eyebrows.
I am really not good at complimenting someone, but I wish the best for you. Don't give up and don't let depression take control over you, I know what it feels like. Talk to people you love, let them help you :)
Depression sucks man it really does but you just got to realize its affecting how you see yourself but not how others see you . Imagine seeing yourself walking down the street like, "Daaaaaammn" You're a handsome dude and you got a good future ahead of you, you just have to see it. Good luck in life man!
These words really hit me in the best way. Thank you for taking the time to answer. Sometimes it all gets heavy in my mind and I just can't see how am I supposed to make it? I'll keep fighting, thank you so much for the kind words. I hope things are good for you!
Thank you! I'll keep fighting!
Thank you for taking the time to read me out. I hope things are going well for you! It helps to see someone who understands these vibes. Thank you again!
Man did I need that! Thank you for the words, it really means a lot to me. I always try to be the positive force around, but there are times when I feel helpless. I love you too! You got me smiling like a fool on my phone aha. I will keep fighting. Thank you again so much! I hope life is treating you as much as you deserve!
I appreciate the love bud, means a lot. Depression sure sucks, I hope you get through and you got the help you need too. You deserve the best things this world can give! Thank you so much for caring!
Thank you, it means a lot! I'm always self-conscious about how I look and the image I project
Thank you so much! Have a great day too!
Thank you for answering! I just find it hard sometimes to appreciate the guy I see in the mirror... It helps to know that people believe in me. Thank you so much again💙
Tbh, I didn't expect so much love, I feel overwhelmed! Thank you for answering me, I'm so stressed about the future when I see the kids who used to be behind me getting their lives together while I'm still here wondering how to get through my days. Thank you for the advice, it helps to see someone who have been through it, making it in one piece! I hope life treats you well friend, thank you so much!
Thank you, I would blush if I could! It really means a lot to hear that, my looks is one thing I have always struggled with, but I'll be working on it! Thank you again for taking the time to read me out (:
Thank you for the kind words! I'm not sure I have a great sense of humour, I mostly do bad puns and feel like I'm awkward aha... Thank you for caring, it means a lot to me to know you're willing to hear me out💙
That's the strength of depression, sometimes you just can't see the difference between what's real and what's not. It still feels odd to me to talk about myself like I did, but I guess it's the first step to recovery. Thank you a lot for helping me today, it means a lot 💙💚💙
Man you should be the writer! You have me dazzled! I don't see myself as a writer just yet, but your words are inspiring me! Thank you so much for the support! I hope life is 💯 💯💯 with you!!
Thank you, you got me smiling like a fool here 💙
Thank you for the kind words, it's appreciated! I hate the feeling of not enjoying things that used to make me happy anymore, I'll keep trying to get back at it! Thank you for listening to my rant. It means a lot to me and I hope life is good on you friend!
you’re welcome, i most definitely believe in you ❤️
Everybody has their own path, you’re gonna be so great. Lots of light and love from across the ocean 💗
Hey, asolutely! Listen. Everybody deserves to be loved, everybody deserves to know they have value. You have plenty. Let me know how you're doing some time, keep in touch. We all gotta stick together in life, there's no room for division. Bless you, and good luck!
Bro, you're a gem. I won't forget that!
You’re very cute: you have beautiful eyes, great pots and pans, and a curious metal antenna in the center of your head. The world is your oyster! 😊♥️
My dude

You have the most beautiful stars in your eyes 💖
You said it yourself, it was a bad relationship. Hurray for you my friend! Ypu will feel better! Smile and banish that sadness from your beautiful eyes!
You are cute as hell and seriously pull off the short hair look!
You’re so good looking! Your eyes are amazing, and you’re really pulling off a shaved head! Take some time to recover and afterwards i’m sure you won’t find any difficulty going on dates.
Congratulations on your escape - the hardest part is behind you now. And here you are, picking yourself up and moving forward!
You got out so you know your on the right path. The next few days/weeks/months may be rocky but once that hold has loosened on you then you'll be on your way with someone better and a better outlook on life and it won't be long before your on here helping people that are in the position you was in. Cause you my friend frickin rock
Hey! I broke up with my ex 3 months ago and I understand that it's not easy. But I do believe that everything happens for a reason. Heartbreak is a part of life and it's almost impossible to avoid. It will eventually get easier and you seem like a very amazing dude. The future is bright! :)
You look like one of the Jonas brothers lol. And that is not an insult in the slightest of course.
you’ve got eyes that smize
You have beautiful doe eyes! 

Don't worry, things get better. If it was a bad relationship anyway, it's all for the best. You will find the right person. 

Also make sure to love yourself! Find one thing a day that you like about yourself. :)

Good luck!
Not a lot of guys can pull off a shaved head but you can! <3
It gets better, trust me. And you look better when you smile :)
It takes so much courage and strength to get out of a bad relationship and you shouldn't feel bad at all. Feel proud of yourself! You got through this so you can most certainly get through anything else you put your mind to! 

Also just remember to take some personal self care time for yourself, getting out of bad relationships can be draining and you deserve to reward yourself or time to take care of yourself. Whether that's going to a restaurant you normally don't go to often because it's fancy/costly or surrounding yourself with people who do love and care about you! It's just a good idea to not lock yourself in the house after ending a relationship especially if it might've been a little toxic. But don't worry the pain of it is going to pass soon!
cool hairline!
Bro. You’ll realize this is the best thing to happen to you. Bad relationships can make you feel worthless, but you’re a good looking dude with a bright future ahead! Chin up!
Your eyes are so beautiful and powerful. Your sadness feels palpable to me, but there's something so lovely and noble in it. Not only do you look great, but it speaks highly of your instincts that you knew where to turn when feeling low. 

I hope you can really internalize the kind things others in these comments have said - you're not just going to be all right. You're going to be amazing. You already are.
You're a handsome bloke with a good set of saucepans. If I was single I'd be messaging you lol 😅
It's not a fun place to be, my dude. But given this was a bad relationship, you'll be grateful you jumped ship when the mate who is right for you comes along :-)
Oh my god, if I was single right now.... oh wait, I am single... Where do you live? 😜
You're too handsome to be feeling bad about what should be good news - it was crappy, and you're out of it. Take those dark, mysterious eyes and go flirt it up, find the lady (or man, or both if that's your kicks) of your dreams and make them wonder what makes a man like you tick.
Disastrously handsome my friend. Be strong, stay true to yourself, and take one step forward every day, big or small. You've got this.
love that paint, youre hot, byeeee.
You seem very handsome and have kind eyes. I know coming out of a bad relationship is rough, but maybe it's like spring cleaning, and now you can meet your soul mate (or at least a great date).

&#x200B;

Good luck out there, and have a great day.
Thank you 😊, yeah as soon as I posted the pic I noticed it too 🙄😂
🥂 toast the toaster for a great toast. Short but very good.
Thank you very much 😊
Thanks, the short hair is usually a hit or miss kinda situation haha 😂
Haha I’ve been called worse 😂
Thank you very much ☺️
Haha why thank you 😅😅
Well I’ll take that as a compliment 👀👀
Thanks mate!
You have such a beautiful smile! You look nothing near 50, to me you look below 30! Take care of yourself, dont let your diabetes put you down. It doesnt define you as a person!
32???? You look like you’re still in college! I want you to give yourself a hug and say “I love myself” whenever you feel like this
A bright, shiny person isn't bright and shiny because they never feel pain, or tiredness, or exhaustion. It's because they are passionate about their impact on the world, and the energy they give to those around them.

You are not a fake. You are not a failure. You care about bringing that light to the world, and that's all anyone ever tries to do.

Give yourself a break, let your energy recover. Everyone needs to do that :)
Your smile brightened my timeline! I'm sure you brighten up the days of people around you. Keep smiling and Take care of yourself dear!
You have a great smile!! Keep your chin up! It will get better. Always does!!
You look so pretty and sweet! great energy in this picture.
Are you sure your not early 20's and having us on cause that's what it seems like. Nah your not a hypocrite either, just trying to look after others who would worry about you.
You look amazing! I legitimately thought you were in your mid-twenties MAX. :0

Also what kind of Asian are you? Sorry if this seems invasive, you don’t have yo answer, but I always ask fellow Asians what kind they are out of curiosity. 😅 (I’m half-Filipino myself!)
You have a nice smile.
I have type 2 diabetes and I noticed that when I get enough sleep, eat responsibly and get active I feel much better.
You look sad behind that beautiful smile, but your beauty still shines through.
You have a very lovely smile and kind eyes! I'd also like to say, it doesn't make you a hypocrite to act that way, if that's who you want to be. I applaud you for keeping a positive outlook in your day to day life, even when your body conspires against that. It can't be easy, but you stay true to who you are, and who you want to be. We all have inner demons that tear us apart from the inside, but people like you keep on going in spite of that, and that's very admirable.

&#x200B;

Please keep that smile, and have a beautiful day!
As a fellow diabetic I feel your pain. 

But damn if I look like you when I'm 32 I'll be hella happy. You look so youthful and you radiate positive energy. I'm willing to bet your bright shiny personality brightens the day of everyone around you.
You have great skin for 32.
Your skin is really beautiful, and you just look so kind and warm! Definitely one of those people I would just look at and think "wow, she's beautiful in so many ways"
You got this!! ✌❤
Hi op! You have got a heart warming smile. You are a brave person for smiling even in the face of tough times,now I am not going to ask you to rough it out,  catharsis is important ,  talk to someone, let it all out. Keep kicking op, you got this!
Oh now I know the reason why you are so sweet. Diabetes. Huh. Just kidding. Times can be rough but wasting such a pretty smile for that, i would recommend you to keep smiling. Also your hair looks amazing
You really smile with your eyes! And nice ring—clearly somebody loves you, which isn’t surprising :P
Hi Kitchpats. :) We all hide our pain sometimes. People routinely tell me how cheerful and peppy I am, for example, but I have major recurrent depression (a permanent kind of sad-brains that needs medicine). Most people are taken aback when they learn this.

Smiling and trying to be normal through difficult times does *not* make you a hypocrite. You're keeping your chin up and paddling along while dealing with some real problems that affect your day to day life. Maybe you don't want to talk about them to everyone, so you smile to get through conversations. That's alright! There is nothing wrong with that.

When you need to be sad or feel ready to be sad (since that moment might not come up with other people around), *let yourself be sad* and do the things you need to when you feel down, sleep in, watch some crummy movies, treat yourself. I don't think enough people allow themselves to have negative emotions these days, and as a result, they expect far too much of themselves and become more distressed when they don't meet their own lofty expectations. Remember to be kind to yourself, as no one will judge you as harshly as you.
Fellow Diabetic here. That's not being a hypocrite, that's resilience. Diabetes drags everyone who has it down, it's a sucky disease that seems to be hard to understand if you don't have. Sometimes it's hard to understand when you do have it. You're not alone, Diabetes UK has an affiliated message board for anyone affected by it, whether you're from the UK or not. They will make you feel welcome, give you a shoulder to cry on and let you be friends with them. I think it's www.diabetessupport.co.uk. Although a lot of the technical advice on there is for UK folks (free meds but patchy access to tech, pumps, meters and in some cases strips) wherever you're from I'm sure you'd be welcome.

Don't let your Pancreas get you down.
😜
Well if one thing is for sure, you are absolutely GORGEOUS!!! That color also looks amazing on you!!
You look like a literal ray of sunshine, and your smile made ME smile! You're exactly the kind of girl I'd love to be friends with =)
You look like you would be a loyal friend :)
Feel like fifty u look 25
You may feel tired and burnt out, but I can see through your smile that there is still a warm and sunny side to you that's wanting to be free and wanting to be out and ready to shine. You've got a fighting spirit in you, and even though you may not feel that spirit right now it's still there. You got this!
Your willingness to cheer others up when you need cheering up says allot about you. Go find a friend and get some hugs. They work wonders!
You look mid twenties. I want to know your secret. 😂 I’m sorry to hear about the health issues, but you must be doing many things right to look so young and vibrant!
You're 50!?! You look great! such a warm and sweet smile. Please take care of yourself
You’re not a hypocrite! You’re a beautiful soul sharing what light you do have, despite feeing burnt out. Remember it’s ok to show what you’re feeling, too, that way others can light you up! You’re doing so great dealing with all the troubles of everyday life + health problems. It’s so draining!! That’s how Ik you’re incredibly strong! This won’t break you. You will get through this!! Your smile perfectly matches that spark of hope in your eye, and we’ll keep being your cheer squad for as long as you need us!!
Kind eyes and a kind smile, I don't think your pretending to be happy. It's OK to feel bad sometime, go easy in yourself
Remember that every human being is beautiful, d9nt let anyone make you feel down you are beautilfuil, unique. Focus on becoming a better version of yourself, forget the past, learn the mistakes and fix them. Leave the mental enivornmenglt your brain is living it and take it to a ppsitive enivornment 😁 spend time with positive people. Hope this helped, if yu wanna take more just dm. Good luck sister
You smile is beautiful, your eyes are very very kind. Hope you feel as great as you look from now on.
Your teeth. Like pomegranate.  I want your teeth omg
Holy heck your skin is so clear and you look so youthful, genuinely thought you were ~25 before i saw the caption!! Its not hypocritical to pretend to be happy, sometimes you have to fake it until you make it but i hope that one day you wont have to pretend anymore <3
You have such beautiful teeth! Your hair is gorgeous also! Xxxx
You look great!
But you’re still gorgeous!
You have a lovely, fresh face and an aura of goodness.
Are you asian, because you look am-asian (play on the word amazin').

This is in no way a racist pun, in fact I am asian myself. I want you to know you're doing great, and that it takes a special, rare type of person to keep smiling through bad days. Stay cute sweetie!
You are only a child :) Wait until you get to be MY age (65 Yikes!!!!). You are beautiful and have a beautiful smile 😊
You're doing great honey! You have such a beautiful smile! Everyone gets burnt out sometimes but just remember to take breaks sometimes. Take a nice bath, pick up a book, turn on your favorite movie! Whatever makes you feel happy inside that can stop you from feeling burnt out, even if for a little, can make such a difference! You got this!
I'm a woman of 31 struggling with depression, and I'm super proud of you. It takes a hell of a lot of effort to be 'bright and shiny' when you're totally not in the mood, and you're an absolute superstar for trying this hard.

I'm similar in that I need to be 'bright and shiny' when I'm at work, but it's all an act really. The way I rationalise it is.... Trying to spread positivity is a noble goal. The fact that you want to do that *despite* your own problems, means that you're probably a deeply caring person. Which means you're probably not as awful/hypocritical as you feel like you are.

That's the way I try to feel about myself, anyway :)
Type 1 here and it is very tough battling this disease everyday. No two days are alike, and sometimes it is just overwhelming. 

A lifelong battle has it's ups and downs. Right now is a rough patch, but you'll persevere. Humor has always helped me through my sugar spikes and lows. 

DM me if you ever want to share ideas or have questions. I've had it for 17yrs and it's always uplifting to help someone on this journey. I sincerely wish you all the best!
You are amazing, beautiful, and you rock! You don't always have to pretend to be happy. Wearing the mask can drain you of way more energy than diabetes can. Cry it out if you have to. You'll find the light at the end of the tunnel soon. In the meantime, just make it through one day at a time! You got this!
Bro this hit home hard for me. I know how you feel. Wearing a mask constantly with no time to take it off... It sucks. But keep your chin up sweetheart! If a dredge like me can do it, I'm positive you can do it too! Just make sure to take some time for yourself! You deserve a good pampering!
Your skin is so beautiful!!! And I love your hairstyle. Plus your taste in stationery is killer. I would love to be your friend
You! Are! Kicking! Diabetes’! Ass! 
As another diabetic person,  you are never doing as badly as you think you are. No way. You deal with so much and you’re entitled to feel down every so often. 
And you shouldn’t feel like a hypocrite - you’re just a normal person trying to keep afloat regardless of external factors. 
Keep it up!!!! Positivity is key! You’re stronger than you know and things will get easier. But at the same time? Recognise your feelings and that you need breaks from time to time. Give yourself those breaks. Everyone needs them, it doesn’t make you weak at all. It makes you human.
Talk to people you trust! Let them in, and let them support you. This can be daunting but so worth it. You have the strength you need to get through this, and you will. 
By the way? You have a really lovely smile.
You are greater than your highs and lows. BG and A1C are just numbers, not measurements of your worth. 

T1D bites, and it can help to connect with people who get it. There are a lot of volunteer opportunities that come with a beautiful built-in support network. Happy to help you connect to one in your area, if desired. 

T1 friends can help you feel whole again even after your endo rips you a new one. Wish you well!
You seem like a kind soul, something the world is tragically lacking. Put that to good use helping others through their hard times, and yours will get better. You have value, and you have purpose. Hope things get better for you soon!
You're so cute. You look 23, not 32! Take a nap - whenever I feel terrible and want to give in, turns out I am just tired. Find some diabetic groups to kvetch with, I know there must be a ton out there!
I'm going to say that if I was a liquor store clerk and you came in to purchase alcohol and the age was 21 I would be really looking at your ID to make sure you are over 21. Not saying you look super young either but I wouldn't have guessed 32 at all 23 tops.
You are bright and shiny though. I'd give you a solid 25 tops.
My experience has been that when I was younger and apparently a cutie I never believed it or could see it due to very low self esteem. As you go through life and begin to learn your own self worth, I think you’ll realize long before I did that you truly are very attractive. But what really makes us beautiful is what shines through from the inside.  May your journey be filled with self realization.
You are so pretty. Your skin glows, and your hair looks beautiful. I am sorry you are going through so much mentally abd struggling with your illness, but physically you look so happy and healthy. You also seem very kind.
You're not a hypocrite. You're putting others first. Which is a wonderful thing but you also have to take care of you. Take a bath, have your favorite treat (that's safe lol) and take some time for you. You deserve it.
You have such an incredible smile! And your skin is perfect 😱 you’re gorgeous! Always remember to take a few minutes out of your day to care for yourself! I understand what it’s like to struggle with an illness, it’s important to do things you enjoy as often as you can!
You're not a hypocrite. You're trying. There's a difference, and good for you for fighting the good fight 💗
Thank you, dear! This illness is taking me down lately, I need to reboot my thinking that this shouldn’t define me.
I've already commented but have to second this opinion. What I'd do for a smile like that!!
Aww!  Thank you!! I love myself, I love myself!
Thank you for the reminder. I do need to recover! ❤️
Take care, too! Thank you ❤️
Looking forward to better days! Thank you ❤️
Thank you ❤️
Thank you but I wish I’m back in my early 20s, I miss my youthful energy!
Heya! I’m 💯 Filipino ❤️ thanks for the kind words, mickee_vee ❤️ it’s amazing to receive a comment from a fellow pinoy 🇵🇭
It gets the best of me, sometimes, but I choose to fight and survive. Have you experienced pain in the legs at night because that’s what’s keeping me up late sometimes.
Have a wonderful day, too! Thank you ❤️
Thank you for the kind words ❤️ I hope my smile helps them through their day ☀️
Thank you ❤️
Thank you, that’s truly uplifting ❤️
Keep reaching to get it ❤️
Thank you for the faith! ❤️
Hehe! Diabetic smile? Lol. Thanks for the kind words ❤️
Thank you! My eyes may be tired but it will never stop from smiling :)
Thank you pom_pom for your wisdom. Yes, I feel like I should let my guard down and get in touch with my feelings. My upcoming 14-hr solo flight might be the perfect timing for that. I hope you are doing fine with your sad brain, if not, I’d be more than happy to give you affirmation.
My pancreas wants to high five yours! Thanks! This is awesome, I’ll try this link! And you’re right, this illness is difficult to understand from the outside— hence it can be dragging sometimes when u try to explain it to others.
Super thanks ❤️
I can be your friend :)
I think I am :)
You are too kind! Thank you!
Thank you for the inspiring words. Hoping for better days ahead!
Thank you!! Virtual hugs to you ❤️
I started going to the gym for starters :) I’m a plus size girl trying to be more active to get a good sugar reading :) thank you for the compliment ❤️
Oh, I’m only 32 but I feel like I’m 50. My energy is kinda low lately :( thank you for the kind words ❤️
You’re sweet, thank you! Sometimes I just feel tired of dealing with this illness but I know there’s no other choice but to keep on moving forward ❤️
Try your best to keep your sugars on point! Keep your chin up too!! I was diagnosed at 29 w type 1 along w Graves’ disease. It’s been a long road but keep that positivity and smile up :) you got this!!!
Thank you for the sweet words ❤️
Thank you ❤️ I will try my best to not let this illness get the best of me ❤️
I appreciate the sweet compliments, thank so much ❤️
Thanks :) trying my best to keep the teeth healthy :)
Looking forward to that day ☀️ thank you ❤️
I guess I chose the perfect highlights for my skin tone, thank you ❤️
Thank you ❤️
Thank you ❤️ I want to see myself like that, too!
Thank you ❤️ you’re too kind ❤️
Yes, I’m an Asian hoping to be an am-asian :) hihi! Thank you for the kind words ❤️
Thanks for the reminder ❤️
Aww! Super thank you! Honestly, this illness is stopping me from enjoying as often as I can, but I need to find new things to enjoy that won’t interfere with my condition.
I’m thankful for being alive. I just want to rest for a while then live another day to fight this illness ❤️
Thanks, super ❤️
We all wish that bud, although maybe not my early 20's as i was a right dickhead sometimes then :-) and my missus would whinge even more about the age difference (she's older) :-)
I get leg pain, but that's from fibromyalgia. My feet have good circulation. 
I have arthritis, tendonitis and bone spurs in several joints. Also fallen arches. I hurts, but I try to stay active.
The worst thing to do is sit or lay around too long.
I rejoined a gym, that always helped my legs, back and midsection in the past. 

What other issues do you have?
Awesome! I'm the same age as you, and between husband, kids, and work, I pretty much have zero friends. I'll message ya!
I was going to the gym and still have the membership but never seem to make the time lately.  I think you are going to accomplish everything you’d to. Thanks for the inspiration. ☀️💛🌱💚
OHHH I misread. I'm so sorry. Trust me I get it lol I'm 31 and I feel the same way. You're beautiful and I hope your energy picks up :)
I get that:/ I struggle with my health on a daily basis, too, and Ik what it’s like to have poor quality of life for indefinitely long periods of time. It’s those brief windows of time when we feel better that we can recharge and remind ourselves of all the good and possibilities in this world. You’re not alone in this:) Don’t lose hope, your windows will come!!
Thanks for the positive thoughts! We can do this! Take care of yourself, too ❤️
No worries
Hehehe! You can go back to your early 20s and change that sometimes dickhead attitude. Lol. Your missus can also go back to her early 20s but then you might be in your teenage years if you move backwards further hihi! That would be cool! ☺️
I also joined the gym late last year but nerve pain at night is still there. I haven’t tried wearing compression socks though, it might help, i don’t know. Besides my legs, I’m having difficulty driving at night already. My last eye exam showed signs of glaucoma.
Anytime, dear ❤️ I’m a great listener ☀️
Thank you, too ❤️
Thank you ❤️
if she went back to her 20's i'd be around 10 - 15 ha ha. The age gets to her now, imagine that one hee hee
Have you tried biking? You work your whole body and it's not load bearing.
Also, you can do squats without added weight, using a chair as support. 
These activities both include working your large muscles and getting your circulation going. Also great for controlling your blood sugar.
I will add that to my routine. Ive been doing 30mins in the treadmill and the other 30mins doing weights. Thanks so much, I really hope this would help! It’s 2am now here and still can’t sleep because of the discomfort :(
I was like that all night. Getting moving was like trying to start a rusty old car
You said it, yeah, that’s what if feels like
My darling I love your glasses! I reckon you should get a lipstick the same colour! It really goes with your dark hair and eyes. 

I hope you have a lovely day!!
Sending love from someone else suffering the heat! I adore your little asymmetrical smile, super cute 💖
You look great, those glasses are really cute on you :)
I really like your hair, and looking through your profile, I definitely want to hang out with you
You look so sweet and have great hair!
You're so pretty! Intense heat will make the most self-confident of us rethink existence, but I bet you rock your life and make the people around you so happy with your presence and great smile
Ugh doesn’t the heat feel awful right now? I definitely feel ya. It just feels super gross... but that doesn’t mean YOURE gross :) you are a huge cutie! I really love your haircut! I hope you’re able to stay cool! Have a wonderful week :)
You're really cute. Love the glasses. And yes, heat is the worst
That's great advice, thank you!
Thank you so much! I never really 'learned' how to smile, but your kindness has me seeing it a little differently 💖
I mean, I'm down to chat if you want to haha
Had me in the first half, not gonna lie haha 
I had a hair appointment next week but it got cancelled, so I'm trying to figure out what to do with my hair now
Happy Birthday dawg! Shirt looks nice on you! What’s the tattoo of?
You're handsome and seem like a wonderful person to be around :) Happy Birthday!!!
Bicep goals 😱
Holy shit, I had no idea Mr. Incredible was on Reddit! Happy birthday man! I'm sorry things are rough. Keep your chin up, believe in yourself, and keep fighting. You look like a good soul and a born leader, you can handle anything that comes your way. Stay strong. We've got your back 💪
You look like a really genuine and down to earth guy! I hope you find yourself right where you need to be. Godspeed, friend.
Happy Birthday! And don't be down on yourself, he seems like a cool dude
Happy Birthday! Cheer up, dude! That frown doesn’t suit that face!
Heyy! You have a handsome and kind face!! I mean that! 💯

Happy birthday! I hope better and brighter days come find you very soon! ❤
heat sucks,  I hope you have fun and don't get too baked in the Desert.
Happily birthday!
Happy birthday! You look like a really sweet person, I'd love to give you a hug 🤗
Hey happy birthday! 36 and still a badass. Good job.
Oh hey, first ever silver.  Thank you, anonymous person!
Happy birthday pal
You look strong yet gentle. I bet someone wants to cuddle with you.
Dude idk much about you, but I can tell you for sure you’re attractive af.
Mjolnir, kind of a mashup of the old traditional style with the Marvel version and an inlaid triskelion pattern that I definitely did NOT base off of a weird mall-ninja throwing knife I found on Google.  Honest.
Ha, thanks.  The biceps are actually hiding under a bunch of loose skin from dropping weight lol
Fuck it dude, a cool tattoo is a cool tattoo. As long as it's well executed and you didn't get it for $20 from a backwater unlicensed ink shop, it could be the most mall ninja shit possible and still be badass.
Good fucking shit bro! Keep it up
you have nice eyebrows and i love your curly/wavy hair!! you look like a very kind person, all the best :)
Relax buddy, we are coming. Things may not be great right now but tomorrow’s gonna be better. Also you got those soft eyes look going for you. Pretty jealous my boy. Hahah
I absolutely adore your eyes! They are beautiful!
nice hair
You have beautiful eyes and kind face. Don't be too hard on yourself. 🤗
You look super cute!
You seem like a teddy bear, chill dog, chill.
I love your hair and you have nice eyes :)
Whoa! Your eyes are beautiful!!! 💯
You have the hair I wish I could pull off. It’s a yes from me
What stunning eyes!
Stunning eyes and lashes women pay a ton trying to achieve!
Aaaaw! You give the impression you are one of those really awesome teddy-bear guys. A lot of women love these laid back dudes that they can hug them and feel safe with. You will for sure attract some really nice ladies and I am pretty sure they will be in good hands - or should I say teddy paws....? 😘
Hey man, it's tough out here. Guys gotta be better than ever, the failures of the men before us mean we're held to a high standard. But you can do this. Good eyes, strong features, and lovable hair? You're set for looks my friend. Follow your heart, stay strong, and be your best self. The good times will come.
Guys really should be complimented more. I don't get why they're not. You have really pretty eyes.
You look very chill and friendly and had that loyal bro vibe coming outta you. Hope your days will get better man.
now to anxiously wait and check the comments every 2 minutes!
You look really good, and you have kind eyes that look like you know how to laugh. I'm sure you bring joy to everyone in your life.
What?? I love your nose! Your brows will grow out.
Those eyes, the hint of smile on your lips, the quirky mess in your hair, that "girl next door" vibe... cute and hot!
Oooo thank you all for being so darling! it’s real chalmomile-like to me.
Um...you’re gorgeous! You give me Carey Mulligan vibes:)
Aww you're simply adorable! Those little things that you think are imperfection is what makes your absolutely perfect. You have a face that someone could crush on quite easily. You also look like you have a big heart and a gentle soul. Work with what you have and you have quite a lot to work with. Keep your head up. You're simply exquisite 😁
You have big beautiful eyes and I love your cute nose. I bet the rest of you is just as beautiful.
You look way better than you give yourself credit for. Nothing wrong with your nose for starters.
I love you face! I love you hair!!! I love everything about how you look! In fact I want to look like you 😍 chin up, darling! From what I see, you're a 10! 

Here's hoping that someday you're gonna see yourself as what you truly are - BEAUTIFUL. ❤
You look like the best looking Angeline Jolie and if I could draw then you'd be the perfect second model (the first would have to be my wife :-).

&#x200B;

Your self perception is obviously not that great :-) as look at these comments, your gonna make everybody who walks past you feel a little better about themselves
You are adorable! I love everything about you (that I can see, hehehe). You would definitely catch my eye we’re we to cross paths
You should give yourself some credit! You look amazing! Your nose looks perfect on you, and your eyebrows look great too!
you're beautiful girl!! keep your chin up!
You have seriously beautiful facial features. Your nose shape is beautiful. I actually think your eyebrows also suit your face despite not being the style that's "in" right now. Your hair really suits you too. Basically you are gorgeous but you also look like you would have an awesome personality too.
Those cheekbones! Those lips! You could be a model, looks like you have exactly the slim build and elegant, dramatic features that they look for.
Your haircut is SO flattering on you! You’re seriously super pretty! I also think you have a cute smile! Sorry you’re feeling down on yourself but just know that this stranger thinks you’re gorgeous! Have a great week :)
You remind me of the princess from Frozen
You look very kind.
Gee thank you again to all of you! I never expected to blush so much. You’re all super duper wonderful!
You have a great smile, it's the smile of a person who can take on anything because they have a joy within :)
You’re radiant!
I agree with the others, that's a smile and a half and you'll bring happiness to others just by them seeing it. To help with your writers block, write a teensy tiny story/poem/paragraph about a little ant landing on the moon.
All these things going wrong and you *still** have such a gorgeous smile! Your eyes are so sparkly and I really do agree with the commenter who called you ‘radiant’ (it’s the best word to sum up your look that I can think of!)
They are. I know you're strong though. And you're really pretty.
Oh no. Those all sound terrible. I can't even imagine what it's like going through just one of them, but you're experiencing them all at once. 😕

I hope things go well for you someday. You remind me of JK Rowling who was rejected 12 times for her crazy magic fiction book, and I hope you have achieve the same success as her. Stay strong 💚
You're beautiful, and your skin looks perfect!
Your skin is flawless and I’m loving those earrings!
I know smiling through the pain works most of the time, probably cause you have a beautiful smile, but it’s also important to take care of yourself! Make sure not to push yourself too hard. I hope things get better.
You have a beautiful smile, all the more for the struggles behind it. I know it may not seem that way now, but as long as you keep trying and remain true to yourself, *your struggles make you better.* keep pushing through the dark, and you will find joy and beauty, eventually.
You are absolutely STUNNING and those bangs look great on you. 

It’s ok to not be strong sometimes, it’s ok to have depression. Your pain is real. 

I wish you the speediest recovery possible.
It is a struggle,  but take it day by day. Step by step. You're doing great!
Looks like you’re in a cubicle, at work, amirite? That right there shows me how strong you are. You’re out there fighting every day 

You are strong, you are worthy, and I salute you.
The fact that your smiling says a lot about your inner strength that you haven’t acknowledged yet
You're really strong, and also really pretty. I hope it gets easier.
You are so so gorgeous and deserve time and love directed at yourself. I hope everyone can support you as much as you support them. Fake till you make it and also reach out 💕
You’re doing a great job!!!!! I’m proud of you and sending you love!!! You look like someone i could giggle for hours with
I hope you have a good support system to help you with the depression because no one deserves to feel that way. Keep that beautiful smile going, write the bad days like yesterday in sand, not stone!
Take time for yourself, please. Do something that makes YOU feel good! You're beautiful!
You're smiling, you're fighting, and each day you go is one more day you kicked the ass of life itself when it told you that you couldn't. You have the strength, courage, and will that moves mountains. You feel the pain but just keep rolling. So don't let it get you down, just go on being the fucking badass that you are!
you have amazing cheekbones <3
Girl, I'm calling Area 51 on you, that beauty is out of this world. Who sent you? Because I'm sure you are not only pretty but valid and you are worth it as much as any other human being on this planet. 

Please take care of your mental health and seek help if you need it, don't smile through your pain, smile because you feel happy. Don't be afraid to talk about it, mental issues are nothing to feel shame about. Please don't underestimate yourself and, of course, don't overexert youself :)
☺ thank you so much
Aww thank you
Thank you so much. I'm hoping i can fake it till I make it
Thank you ❤
Thank you so much🤗
Thank you
Thank you🤗
Thank you. I'm trying to tap into it
Aww thank you so much🤗
Thank you❤
thank you!! Yes, I'm very silly so that's likely lol
Thank u. Happy cake day
lol you're awesome!! thank you
thank you :)
this was so sweet!! thank you, truly :)
This is much more than I deserve for failing to mention how sick your cheekbones are. Like, no contour needed, 100% all natural poke-you-in-the-eye sculpted realness. 

A thousand apologies for the oversight.
Thank you!
Thank you!! You're too kind
At least you’re super cute!
Nice piercings and tattoos, you totally look like the kind of person I'd love to be friends with.
Florida state bird biting your butt. Lol Sometimes you just grin and bear it. Lol
Your hair looks so floofy and soft, I love it!
I really like the glasses and earrings on you. And a quick look at your profile and I already want to hang out with you
As someone who's trans, I hear too many horribly sad stories. I'm glad you made it through. This journey every trans person is on can be incredibly difficult, but you are amazing! The fact that you don't know just how awesome you are makes you even cooler! It's really hard to be brave enough to come out, but you did it! I still can't come out yet myself, but I dream of the day where I'm in a position that I can. You also look really handsome!

&#x200B;

Be wonderful to yourself, you deserve only the best!
That’s a cool hairdo
You have amazing eyes. The kind that you are pulled into. They’re really something special. Also, I love your hair! You’re super handsome, seriously. I’m so happy you’re doing better, and I hope you have a wonderful day.
Hey bub, I'm glad you're still with us. I'm also glad you got the help you need. 

I want to say that I love you unconditionally, I think you're a very handsome feller, and everyday you make this world a more beautiful place just by being yourself.

Sending love, happiness, encouragement, hope, and other positive thoughts.

Cheers.
You seem extremely sweet, I feel so horrible that someone as beautiful as you is suffering from suicidal thoughts... I genuinely hope you get better, hang in there dude because it will get better <3 <3
Hey buddy. One of my best friends is a trans man, and he's certainly dealt with suicidal ideation (as have I.) Let me tell you what I would tell him if he were in a similar situation- *your hardships make you better.* The world is a better place for having you in it. I've been hospitalized for the same reason as you countless times, and while things may look dark now, *it does get better,* so long as you work hard and are true to yourself. I stress this last point most of all, be true to your own heart and the rest will follow. I believe in you ♥

Edit: I want to add that the friend I mentioned is one of the hippest, most stylish dudes I know, and you remind me a lot of him!
You are so handsome and strong!! Taking care of yourself, including your mental and physical health, is never a failure. You deserve to feel so proud.
There is no failure in seeking help. If you’re still here, you’re a winner.
You’re awesome, man!!! There is nothing wrong with needing professional help and those who accept it are so strong!!

You deserve to be happy.

Also eyeliner on point!!
And you're really good looking. It is not failure to need help. It is not a failure to get help. It is part of being human. I think you're strong for going in. And I hope you're happy back at home. I'm an 18 year old trans girl who's had similar problems. I wish you the best
You’re not a failure! You look very nice and I hope you feel the best you can!
Allow this to stoke your bright fire! If there’s any way, any way at all, that you can allow this to be a beautiful thing, that you’re here now on the other side, I can see in your face you’re going to change the lives of everyone you meet by sharing your story. Thank you for being here, you have a special lightness to you that is shown even in a photo.

Edit: for whatever reason just your face alone looks like someone I would be really really good friends with. Maybe in another universe, past or future. Hope to meet you, friend!!!
I remember trying to commit suicide at 18, that was "fun". The good news is you'll be fine. I'm 33 now and life got much better after I got agency over my life with a job of my own.

On the note of being a trans guy, if not for the make up, I'd of assumed male. So that seems to be going well for you.
So you're a guy...
You're not a failure for having gone, you're a hero for having made it through. You're not weak for thinking ill of yourself, it proves your strength that you fight back. You are a light in the darkness and I am encouraged by your courage to stand up, even to yourself.
Damn dude I dig your hairdo but fr tho never give up itll seem like shit but power through and it will get better I can personally guarantee it you just gotta work through it
Keep winning dude, you’re doing fantastic and we’re all so proud of you.
Suicidal ideation is the worst man I’m with you. It’s hard to not feel discouraged/disappointed/ashamed of hospitalized for me too, but I just try to remember that it just proves I’m a strong-ass motherfucker trying to care for myself, and that’s what you’re doing too! 
I’m proud of you for being hospitalized. It’s so easy to just choose not to. 
You’re an incredible, handsome, strong-ass man and I hope you’re having a great day, and see a cute animal of your favorite sort.
My man, everything brave is going to be labeled as failure by those less brave than you. I’m proud of you for taking care of yourself. Also I’m really, really, really attracted to you ok bye
You look great! And you sure know how to take good pictures of yourself. I really admire that.
Furthermore, kickass wings, I fuck up my eyeliner constantly and I’m v jealous
Way to go hun, mental battles can be the toughest to conquer and it takes a strength not everyone understands. 💪🏼 here’s  to a better tomorrow and and even better day after that :) 💕
Oh man I wish I had your shirt! I love it I bet your a cool dude man keep on going and be strong bud
Aww you cute baby you'll be alright
You have really beautiful eyes. 

Keep up the fight!
You know how sometimes you can just look in someone's eyes, and see intelligence and authenticity? That's what I see when I look at you. I have a boatload of diagnoses myself, and no matter what you feel, I want you to know that it doesn't make you any less of a person. You're young, you have *so much* great shit to look forward to. The dark times provide contrast, and just make the good times that much brighter. I think you have a really rich, fantastic life ahead of you ♥
Lookin good bro
Keep fighting the good fight!! You deserve to be happyyyyy
Major kudos for pushing through! That's never easy, so please know that you are a very strong person. You have lovely eyes and a nice face. Good luck with everything!
Something about your face is so sweet and just utterly loveable.
You have an amazingly cute face, and beautifully unique looks!
I have and still am going through some of my own mental health issues, and I know even to be recovering is an amazing step, as most people do not even seek help in the first place. So long as you are determined, you will be back on track in no time!
Keep up the good work and I hope to see you in a better place very soon!
Great style - love you shirt and hair! Keep fighting it will get easier brother!
GO HARUKEN!!! Sweet shirt dude!
Especially since it looks like you might be in your teens—you have really good skin! How do some people manage to get all the way through adolescence and young adulthood without the curse of pizzaface?? A lot of people you know are probably jealous of you for that, lol. And the messy moptop haircut is totally charming.

I’m fixing breakfast over here and I wish I could sit you down and make you some toast and listen to what you’ve got going on. Do you take butter, marmalade, or both? :P But even from a long way away, I do want to let you know that even if there’s nobody around right now who you’re close enough with to talk things out, you’re still surrounded by people who wish you well and hope for the best for you even if they don’t know you well, because surprisingly enough, that actually is human nature. You can’t feel it when you’re in the midst of a bad time mentally, but there’s there’s human warmth all around you that’ll be there for you to rediscover when you’re ready. Best wishes for things getting better as soon as they can.
I was confused for a moment because you’re really attractive and look like you have your shit together. I definitely know battles with mental illness and there isn’t a harder or more worthwhile fight in this world. You’re not alone.
We know you've got good taste cause of the T-shirt and if you play that as well as you battle your issues you must beat it every time :-). You look like the kind of guy that knows how to treat everyone and I bet your a real asset to your buds
Dope hair and dope shirt. Keep being you. You got this, and we’re so proud.
i won’t give up. thank you!
♥️ much appreciated:)
holy shit thank you 🙏
woot woot!
thank you!
thx :)
You’re still young enough to accomplish so much. Just look forward. Forget about what happened in the past.
1. That's a magnificent beard.
2. Nice mycological decor! Fantastic taste.
3. Careers are fluid, dynamic things with a different path for every individual such that success isn't so easily judged. If you're employed and don't completely hate your job, you're ahead of the curve. If you're employed and completely hate your job... Well, you're both no less than average and have well over more than half of your work life left to make changes.
damn dude thats a great beard. also as a graphic designer, I appreciate the work put in to the card. nice choice on the typeface too, is that courier?
Buddy, you are truly eye-catching! Wowzer!
Life is shitty sometimes... but you have an awesome beard :)

I’m sorry this is a hard time you’re going through. I am sending you all the positive vibes in the world
It’s is literally never too late to realize the things in your life that are going wrong, and to make a change based off that insight. This is a pivot point in your life. From here on in, things get exponentially better. Living with the goal of finding and aligning with authenticity and purpose is so goddamn rewarding. This is your time.
Everyone has a form of insecurity don’t let it ruin your life. Even if you say your degree is useless (maybe it’s not) but I’m sure the experience you got from learning and pushing yourself to get a masters shows your dedication and strength to push on. As for relationships sometimes some people are only suppose to be there a certain part of your journey and relying on someone to not make you feel lonely isn’t the point. Now it’s a time to work on yourself learn new things and push yourself harder and you can do it!
Hey man I bet you're a great friend and tons of fun to chill with. I'm sorry about the relationship, but you're lucky to get to experience a relationship VS. no relationship. Do you have any creative endeavors?
The post office should give your beard its own zip code so it can receive fan mail.
According to the daisy wheel in my typewriter, yes it is 😂
Actually yeah, I do have some creative outlet. I am trying to focus on some of that to keep positive.
Cool hair!
Thanks for your comment :) I love your piercings and earrings! Blue looks good in your hair too!
Opal is the coolest! Also now I want snacks.
You rock!
Blues singer? Thats dope as fuck what do u like to sing?
I've been ghosted a million times. It sucks, but it's part of life. And the truth is, it's their loss, because you are an interesting, multifaceted person who anyone should be happy to know. The most attractive thing a person can have, imo, is passion, and you've definitely got that!
When people ghost you, they are actually doing you the favour of not having to deal with their cowardly asses for any longer than you already have. 

Take your excellent haircut and your cute AF pixie energy and go find someone better.
I love your hair, and I like your whole look. And why do you think you're going to get ghosted? You look like someone who's really cool
God you're adorable!! So pretty and I love your overall style! F that loser who's ghosting you! It's his loss. You're totally a CATCH. 💯
You are a cutie!
I´d love to hear you sing ! Any public audio clips that i could listen to ?
Girl. Next. Door. I would date the absolute fuck out of you.
I really like your hair and your style suits you super well. Just got one thing..... I'm British and you do not toast a teacake because it will melt, but nice analogy
Thanks! You can't really see here but my lip and nose studs are also opals haha
Mostly just do covers of classic stuff, with my own twist if I'm feeling adventurous. You know, Arthur Hamilton, Robert Johnson, Freddie King etc. It won't go anywhere but it makes me happy so :)
None that I know of, maybe one day I'll post to Reddit in some way and see what you guys think :)
I'm also British my friend, and you're thinking of specifically Tunnock's; there are other forms of toastable teacake
Well done nonetheless!
I think thats awesome, u should be proud of your talents
Absolutely ! And as for the ghosting and turning down. Musically i´ve been there several times. On the other hand, those turndowns has made me to improve the "Me" -sound in my tracks.

&#x200B;

You´ll achieve your goal, i´m sure of it !
Ooooh yeah I forgot and I should know it as a poshboi ™ but anyway you have awesome style and I really like your choker
Thank you! And now I know I don't give off an automatic tea-drinkin' scone eatin' English vibe ahahaha :))
You're very welcome and you should take my lack of English recognisation as a compliment because I don't like the English on the most part
Your hair looks so healthy and you have an awesome smile!
I WANNA BE YOUR FRIEND
I love your genuine smile
You look like you give good hugs and I would like one please.
Hey it's Sk8ter Boy.  Nice to see you and your adorable smile here again.  You really are an incredibly talented man and a wonderful companion.  If you'd ever like a friend to talk to, you can always PM me.
You are damn cute
You are cute! Love your hair and smile :)
You look like that friend who come with the best jokes and have demand for you becouse he know exactly what can you do and everything want your good
Love the hair man!!! It’s glorious
Dont know what kind of music you listen to but you give me that "cool-as-fuck-rockstar-reggae-man" vibe
Cool hair!
Beautiful smile! Especially your eyes can really see the joy in them.
GREAT SMILE!!!!
Beachy hot-dad energy.
Your smile made me smile. Also, like, I want your hair.
You really are cute, man!! And that smile! It's just contagious ;) thanks for posting! You've sent us the good vibes 💛
What an awesome smile you have there !
SO CUTE. I thought i remembered seeing your sweet face here before :)
You are cute! Keep smiling internet stranger!
Looks like you floss good.
Glorious hair and very cute face 🖤
You look like a guy that would be a blast to hang out with. Cheers, bro. Keep smiling.
You look like a Rock Star!! 🔥🔥🔥
That smile is like "I'm your best friend" and "I'll buy this time" and "I made you a mixtape" and "I ate the last donut, don't be mad" and "Let's watch Netflix, you can pick the movie" and "Go for it, buddy, I got your back" all rolled up into one.
You look like that good and fun friend that brings joy to a party
You’re cute as heck friend :)
Thanks 😊 I try to keep it nice
I wanna be your friend too
😄
Just one? You can have as many as you want 🤗
Nice to see you too! And likewise here, my DMs are always open to new friends 🙂
Not as cute as you 💕
Thanks 🙂
I'd like to think that I do, but most of my humor is self depreciation and memes so 😂
I'm glad you like it 😊
😊

I listen to lots of things, to include pop-punk, heavy metal/metalcore, kpop, techno, vaporwave, stuff like that. Just depends on my mood really
Thanks 🤙
Thanks, kind person 😄
Thanks for the nice comment 🙂
😎😎
I’m glad I could make you smile too 😊
Awesome! I hope you keep smiling too, kind person 🤗
And I used to feel so self conscious about it too haha
I like to pop in here every now and then since everybody is so sweet and nice 🤗
Will do, kind stranger!
I don't but I should. I kind of neglected self care for a long time, I'm working on it but not trying to overwhelm myself by doing everything at once, if that makes sense
💕💕
And cheers to you! :)
Sometimes I wish I really was one
This is a great toast, thanks 😄 I hope you have a nice day :)
I sure do try to :)
Thanks friend :)
Ballyhoo, 311, chili peppers, tropidelic, pasadena, bumpin uglies; all amazing bands, really reccomend if youre into the pop-punk-rock kinda mood

Jam on, my friend 🤘
No prob! Keep rockin that hairstyle my guy!
I was ready to feel like shit today, but you just made my whole goddamn day :)
Of course I do understand. I'm trying to do one thing at a time too. Last week I painted my room. And that took, what, like 6 months for me? But completion is completion. Cheers to you too.
I will check them out for sure! 🤙
I'm really happy to hear that 😊 I hope you have a lovely day :)
I really like the Hawaiian shirt it’s a really cool and unique addition to your outfit!
Good taste in movies!
You got spit on.  But at least you don't have period blood on your pants!  

Not every day can be a good one but there is always a chance for a brighter tomorrow.   

Show the world your smile. It might just smile back.
2018 was the worst year of my life, despite having experienced horrible traumas in earlier years. The funny thing about life, is that the bad years make you better. They provide a backdrop which you can compare yourself against in the future. Fuck the rest, believe in yourself.
I agree about the shirt! Try not to let the customer get to you. Keep in mind that most people aren’t like that and what he did had more to do with him and his issues than anything you said or did.
A weird way to look at things but some years have got to be the worst so others can be the best. 
Know that you deserve to be treated better at work and maybe look at going somewhere else. 
Even if it’s a really little thing, try to change anything you can in your life at the moment. No matter how small. You still have so much time to turn this year around. Good luck!!
No one should have to go through that. You deserve better
You didn’t deserve that, it’s happened to me as well.  You’ll have much better days. At 19 years old you’re going to have tons of good days ahead.
Customer service sucks... its also been a shitty year for me but we both got this!!! Life sucks sometimes but it is worth it and I believe in you
Your hair is so goddam lush you can barely contain it. Have you been shampooing with the nectar of the gods ?
Keep going. Maybe 2020 will be the best year of your life, cancelling out 2019. Also, don't take   
 what that person did personally. They're just an asshole
What the hell who would do that! No one deserves that, dude! Damn.

Keep you head up high, better and brighter days are ahead of you and I pray they come find you soon!!! Hang in there! You're worthy and you are loved. Just keep going.

PS. You are cute! 😁
customers are assholes im so sorry that fucking sucks but at least you got Superbad lmao. I also like your shirt its very moana vibes
Customers are the worst.... I am so sorry someone did that to you. I really hope your year gets better.  If you ever need a friend or someone to talk to let me know! Otherwise I’ll be sending good vibes your way :) 

Ps I love your taste in Hawaiian shirts :)
I dig the shirt and Jonah Hill in the background. Sorry that people can be monsters. That is assault and NEVER warranted. People can suck, but don't let it get you down.
That customer sounds like a really pathetic person and I’m sorry they brought more negativity in your life. Keep your head up—we’re more than halfway through the year and the bad times don’t last forever. Also, you’re a very attractive guy (this is coming from a female haha), so hey you got that going for you! (:
You look like the best dad for a kid
That would seriously suck, I hope you are doing okay and just remember you have a glorious head of hair that is like a freaking lion's mane (which is awesome).
Focus on making time with the kids as "normal" as possible. Be available, be open. Listen.  You look like someone who has an easy time with that, so keep it. The days are long, but the years are short.
You look hella cute
Sounds like you handled a difficult situation as maturely and gracefully as possible. I hope you'll enjoy the time you spend on yourself now, rediscovering what makes you happy and setting new goals.
The good news at the kids will still be there, and you can still be a major part of their life! You'll get to watch them grow and enjoy a lifelong relationship with them! The flow is great. You pull it off
You look absolutely fucking full of love. It’s beautiful. Never stop spreading it.
Oh they aren’t mine. They’re hers. They started calling me Dad just about a week before she decided to split. I don’t really think I’ll be seeing them again. Whether it’s good or bad, it’s what it is.
Did you get evaluated for autism with post-concussion syndrome? If you did, the neuropsychologist should lose their job. But anyway, you're working hard on seeing the bright side of things. That's why you're asking for a toast. If you can manage that while life is getting you down, you're stronger than most people. You simply don't give yourself enough credit and I would like to remind you that you are an amazing person. You deserve to be happy and you will be happy again soon.
So far I count 3 on this who are have put their (User) names on the petition to change your Conviction. On both counts.

I am married to someone with BPD and a host of other things and she often feels the same way. Sometimes about me. Someone who has been with her for 16 yrs and married for 11. So please know that there is a future. Granted they are not they same (or at least diagnosed properly with the same) issues you are facing but there are people out there who want to change your mind.


You have gorgeous hair, a lovely facial structure and when the smile comes I am sure it is waiting for. Allow yourself to smile. Treat yourself to a warm glow every so often. You have it harder than most so the more often you can tell yourself that you still deserve that chance, the sooner you can lend YOUR voice (internal or out loud), both are valid) to telling yourself you are worthy. Stick around, please.
Hey friend, I have a shitload of diagnoses myself. Disregard that shit. I don't mean don't treat your illness; what I mean is don't let your illness inform who you are. You've got a hard road ahead of you, no denying that,  but if you can live through it, it'll only make you better. Just imagine, a girl like you can become completely invincible. I believe in you 100%.
You are a very beautiful lady!! And despite having these diagnoses or not, you deserve to love yourself and face this with a positive attitude. I know things may not seem great right now, but I truly hope you know that things always seem to come back around.
I think you are attractive and I don't think you should let negatives define you. I know it is hard but try and focus on the parts of you that you like the most. I'm rooting for you!
I'm really sorry you've got so much to deal with. That's a heavy load to bear, and you're doing a damn fine job. You are strong and beautiful and one day you will come to believe it. I know you won't be able to accept this now, but I absolutely know that there are some people for whom "dealing with" you is the high point of their day. Please remember; you have a condition that makes it difficult for you to see things the way others do, and it will keep you blind to the best points about yourself. Please be kind to yourself, because you are absolutely worth it.
You have a beautiful face shape, gorgeous eyes and you also seem to have very pretty long hair! Don’t let a diagnosis be the measurement of your value, you’re much more than that!
Let’s just address the last part of your post first...a lot of women pay a ton of money for Botox treatments in order to have such full lips that you just have naturally.  I would bet that everyone who has ever kissed you will forever measure everyone else’s kiss to yours.  You are amazingly beautiful!  I am not sure I have the right words to say to make you not feel anxiety and depression...however, I would say that you seem so kind, sweet, loyal, and have good character.  A lot of people could use someone just like you in their lives.
Life can be tough, but you're not the only one. I'm on the autism spectrum, with bi-polar disorder and either ADD or ADHD (doctor hasn't decided which yet). My wife has PMDD, PTSD and PCOS. You've got our empathy. And if a schlub like me can find an amazing gal, there's someone out there for you. You are valuable and you are worthy of love and happiness.
You’re adorable. I hope you can get some relief from those things. It may take some time but I know you can do it. I worked with someone on the autism spectrum. He shared that it was a struggle for him growing up, but once he got evaluated and learned to live with it things got a lot better for him. He just got married. I struggle with identity stuff as well. Im working on being kind to myself. Seems strange that it’s such a hard thing to do. Looking up self compassion has been helping me. You’re worth it! Did I mention that you’re really pretty?
You are attractive your eyes are beautiful I wouldn’t be able to stop staring at them if we were talking ❤️
You're beautiful. I've got some labels on myself from diagnoses (bipolar, anxiety, hardcore depression), so I understand the struggle and I definitely understand the "nobody should have to deal with me." But you're a lot more than those diagnoses. I don't want to say a bunch of cliches because they won't help. But you seem very, very lovely and I'm here if you ever need to talk about anything. You may not think they're strong, but you've made it until this moment and that isn't nothing. In fact, it's everything. Take it slowly and realize you've made it this far. Try not to think about the future, just by moments.
You know, with that slew of bad luck you could have given right up, but here you are, taking care of yourself - that speaks really highly of you, that in such a dark place you could reach out.

Also, FYI, objectively you have a wonderful face structure, so you don't need to worry about that. Sure, in this picture you're not glammed up - but that doesn't mean your natural form isn't showing through.

Some good points for you to focus on - let me break down why you don't need to worry about looks:

- Thick, strong hair in a lovely honey colour. 
- Well shaped eyebrows
- Almond shaped eyes that are gorgeously dark and expressive
- Well shaped, straight nose that fits your facial structure
- Full lips people would pay for
- Danity jawline and elegant cheek bones
You're carrying a heavy burden BUT:

\-you are a valuable human being, even if you're facing more challenges than the average person doesn't mean you're less worthy. It makes you a badass and I'm sure you have a lot to bring to the world. Also, you are loved more than you can possibly imagine.

\-less importantly: you are very pretty :) you do not see yourself as we do, you are a beautiful young woman and you should be proud!
You tried well. The light is just beginning to shine on your face again.
You have a beautiful face which does not belong in the dark.🤗
Sometimes life can be unfair.  I dealt with mental issues of my own for a few years and I can tell you it does get better. 

You're a beautiful lady and you have so much to offer the world.  Being diagnosed with something does not mean the end of the line. In fact some of the most influential people in history showed signs on autism and other mental disorders.  
You define who you are, not a piece of paper.  

In a world where social media favours "perfect" people. We need more imperfection, the beauty of life and not of false image. 

Stay strong and be positive.  You're worth every atom!
First, you're not a diagnostic. You're a person.

And I know these things make everything so hard to deal with, but when you say "I feel that no one should have to deal with you", I felt that. Because that's what I thought for a long time. Thing is, even if I hated myself for a long time, I found people that really love me for who I am. I didn't understand, hell, I still don't understand it sometimes. But like my therapist said, "people can like you for no apparent reason (at least reasons you can't understand), whether you like it or not". I'm sure people like / will like you because you're an amazing person, that deserves the fucking world. 

Also, you're really attractive, and well, I just hoped you could see it!
When you find that person it isn't a matter of "dealing with you". Everyday is worth it. Both my gf and I have our own issues and insecurities about "putting" them on eachother. Everything about her is what makes her beautiful. Am I against her seeking help, no, but I'm also not going to give up because some days are hard. It's small steps everyday. The little things you are able to accomplish make the biggest difference. Making your bed, brushing your teeth or hair. Say something positive to yourself everyday if possible. You have a bigger impact on someone's life than you know and everyday is the chance to do that again.

  


P.s. you're beautiful
You are super cute.
You are so beautiful and have a charming quality about you, im not the best with words but despite your diagnoses youre deserving of care and love
i love you! youre a strong beautiful human with lots of great potential
Your beatiful inside and out
You are here with us. You’ve gotten help to sort thru your difficulties. You have strength and will get stronger as you harness these dragons. Everyone that wants to improve their life deserves help and love. You deserve it. And yes you are attractive. Lovely eyes and that brave smile- long pretty hair... yes. You are attractive. This is hard but you are taking the climb to a good life. It will come in time. This world needs you bc you are here. Some day you will find out your reason for being brought to life.
Hey there. I'm also autistic, and I also have a lot of mental health issues. I'm here for you if you need anything. And you deserve all the love in the world. Don't let anyone convince you otherwise. I hope things get better soon.
Whenever I try to cheer my friends up, i am always shy of words, because whatever I say, it will seem hollow and cliche.   


Instead, as someone that has been sick for more than 15 years (with different issues, granted) I am convinced we are more than any labels we collect along the way. We should not identify with those, we are more than that. They are just here so other people can help us.   


But you are not just those labels, you are a lovely woman that has her own passions and is more than the sum.   
Just like me. And I would love it if you could reply to me and tell me what interests you.   
That is what I would love to learn about you and I hope you can tell me.   


Me personally, I have been struggling with Chronic fatigue syndrome and a couple of months ago, some people suggested to me to look into possible autism as a source of extra fatigue. In a few hours, I have my last appointment in the diagnostic track and it is very likely that the result is indeterminable. (Due to the lack of information from my youth.) But that is only a small part of me, I love playing board games and whenever I have enough energy I will try to play a game with friends. And when am bedridden, I love to listen to fantasy novels.   


What do you love to do?   


Besides that, I do want to reaffirm what other people have written, you are a beautiful woman. I can see the pain in your eyes, but despite that, your beauty still shines through!
I don't know what it is, but you have a very comforting face. I look at it and feel at peace. Things may be bleak right now, but I haven't heard of a single person whose life sucked all the way through. Keep your chin up and smile! If no one else does, I've got your back!
Girlllllll, you’re gorgeous!!!!
It’s harder to be yourself than it is to be anyone else, isn’t it? I live with DID, plus I had the amazingly awful benefit of devoting myself to studying identity before leaving academia. That was before I found out though. 

Thing is, now that you know and have all these labels, these boxes, you now have an opportunity to be formless. You can be in the box when you need to be, but your real existence is the time where you move between the boxes. The path is the point, and your path brought you here where you might now be reading this. 

Boxes are hard, stubborn things that can’t feel. People are weird creatures who don’t stop being bizarre, emotional and contradictory. But it’s okay because you are aware. That awareness is not so prevalent, and I applaud you on it. 

Do you like reading? If so there’s a couple pretty great books on psychological trauma I could recommend, plus a few subs on here that might be helpful. 

I hope you’re doing well and remembering to breathe easy and hang loose.

I'm not going to dive in to all of the other stuff because people have already discussed it, but I just wanted to let you know that you are beautiful. I'm not trying to make you feel better by saying that, it's just the truth. You need to know that you are definitely way more attractive than you give yourself credit for. Keep being you and don't let any of your issues weigh you down, ESPECIALLY any insecurities about your looks. You're very pretty and you just need to accept that :)
Be gentle with yourself, nobody (literally nobody) is so deeply flawed that they don't deserve love and compassion.
You look adorable
I have 80% of the issues you just mentioned, none of those disorders would stop me from dating someone that is struggling with the issues you just mentioned.

Ohh and everybody else is correct you are extremely attractive.
I saw your picture first before i read and the first thing I thought was wow she’s really pretty. 

Also, just remember darling, you are always worthy of love and care. Don’t forget that.

Edit: Some syntax issues lol
I hope you have a toasty day, and get out of the flunk, having a medical issue it is hard to live life some times, how ever you must find ways to press on and continue with daily life.  It takes a special some one to want to date certain people, You will have to keep looking until you find that special some one.  good luck
You are cute af , don't know what you are trying to talk about with your attractivness but I would 100% date you :)
You’re SO cute! And none of those diagnoses define you. ❤️
Idk why but when I saw your picture it made me smile. You look like a really kind, sweet, and caring person. And actually you are cute. Honestly you should be proud of yourself for what you have accomplished. It might not seem like much, but I know people that have less health issues than you do and never leave their bed. You're awesome really.
Your smile, although it may be forced and perhaps feels wrong to you given your situation, is absolutely beautiful; and the fact that you at least attempted a smile says more than you know about your ability to overcome your hardships. I believe in you <3
Actually, you look great. Your depression is causing you to see yourself as lesser than who you are. Trust me that looks are not your problem. And you are certainly not a burden, you are a gift to the world in your own unique way. Some of us have to deal with bigger mental baggage than others, and in the end you will only be stronger and more resilient for it. 

You’ll get through the worst of this, you should believe in and hope for a brighter future, because you have more going for you than you realize, and nothing in your mind will define how likable, valuable, or how attractive you actually are. 

As someone who deals with DP/DR, anxiety and depression, keep searching for the bright side in things, because you will find it in yourself to find that brighter tomorrow, especially if you keep smiling :)
You will be okay, you have the kindest eyes. My sister has some overlapping diagnoses with you and I love that little munchkin with all my heart, so even if you don't feel it, there are people who are capable of loving you.
Girl, you look like an amazingly nice person! I bet, if we had ever met in person, we would have been friends immediately. Because I pick my friends by kindness and good heart. And you not only shine from the inside, you also have this really sympathic look. Like a little angel. Stay true to yourself. You are amazing! Amazing special edition ❤️
All I have to say is, wow. You've got to have a soul forged in fucking steel. All that, and you still fight, still keep kicking? You're fucking awesome. And cute to boot. Go you, man. I definitely believe in you.
You really have a lot on your plate ma'am, so if anybody deserves to be afforded leeway, it's you.  You're not unattractive, boring, or a nuisance in any way, shape or form.  You ma'am are a beautiful woman and more importantly intelligent, deliberative, and full of intrigue.  I feel like we could have long, introspective conversations in which we ponder esoteric topics like quantum mechanics, cosmology, the meaning of life, etc.  Very few people can offer such stimulating conversation and for that you should be immensely proud.  It would be such a rare gift and a privilege to call you a friend.  If you would ever like a friend to talk to, my PMs are open.
> I’m not even attractive to help my case.

You're kidding me right? I'd be lucky to have a girl as pretty as you talk to me, let alone hanging on my arm.

Quit saying nonsense like that!

Real talk: Just because you don't look like a model, doesn't mean you aren't attractive.
You’re beautiful. Very attractive. You look like a very interesting and intelligent person. I could totally stalk you. 

Don’t let these times define you. Don’t let your past define you. Live in the moment and define yourself. You will get through these times. It may change you, you may never be the same, but that’s what life is all about. I hope you find happiness within yourself. Learn to love yourself for who you are and not want to be someone else.   Everyone else is dumb anyway. Eventually you will meet someone who sees you for how you see yourself.
I don’t comment a lot to be honest but I think you’re pretty asf.. I logged in just to comment I hope everything goes well for you I’m wishing you the best of luck
I want to deal with you. You’re also beautiful, and so brave. Keep trying to smile. <3
You remind me a little of Emilia Clarke tbh. You're really cute c:
No, they were due to separate (though a little overlapping) symptoms.  Post-concussion syndrome was last August, and is mostly in my frontal lobe (I have terrible memory problems), but is generalized throughout my entire brain (getting into the cause would require a lot of setup which I don’t think anyone cares to read through).

I was just evaluated earlier this month for autism by a separate professional I’m seeing closer to where I live (PCS doctor is in another state), stemming mostly from my difficulty with socializing and understanding others.  I have very few friends and struggle with making them.

I appreciate your words, though.  I don’t believe that I’m a strong person, but maybe one day I can be if I can make it through this.
I guess I don’t even know who I am.  Most of myself is made up to be around other people, because people actively don’t want to be around me if I’m actually being pretty uninhibited with my “personality.”  Not that I become rude or mean at all, just that I say a lot of the wrong things I think and talk too much about things no one else cares about.  I feel like the worst combination of clueless and boring.

I just feel like I’m not worth it to the world, to anyone, or even to myself.  I’m trying to be better, but I still feel pathetic.
I like most board games too, but I’m also really into magic the gathering.  I know the players get a bad rap, but the community where I live is actually quite supportive.  It’s really hard for me to find people who will play with me though, and I’m honestly not that good at making decks so I usually get stomped on.

I really enjoy a lot of forms of art too.  I used to produce a lot more, but more and more it’s really hard for me to sit down and get into a piece sadly.
I actually have a friend who bears a very close resemblance to her, haha.
Former boxer, here... Good and balanced nutrition, and staying hydrated whilst allotting for ample sleep are the only way to heal the brain IMO.
Let me give you a clue I wish I was given: those functional, successful, attractive adults? They have no clue who the fuck they are either. You've got a leg up knowing your own weaknesses. Embrace yourself, you've got so many more challenges and yet you're still alive.
Can I just say that you’re doing great and I’m proud of you. The fact that you’re brave enough to open up about this is just amazing.

I know things are difficult now but don’t let all that define you. You’re a wonderful person, we’ve all got things to work on so just take your time
I talk too much about things that others don't think of as important too, it doesn't matter if they think it's not important because it's just like food, people have different tastes and like some things a lot more than others, as long as it's important to you it's important.
I got the most societal approval when I was Not handling my issues well. Other people aren’t always a good barometer with how well you are doing. Sometimes the better at dealing with our own issues we get the more resistance we get from other people. 

The deep down feeling we aren’t good enough is fictional. Why is it when we are depressed we behave as though we have the most insight into who we really are ?

When it’s the reverse that is true.
I can relate so much <3 All of my pre-adult life was spent trying to fit in. Then one day I started studying physics and then I realized I was finally with my peers: socially awkward to different levels, nerdy, etc. We were a bunch of misfits and we accepted each others. 

Bottom line: you're at an age where everyone is figuring out their identities. It's hard for everyone, but especially for those of us who don't fit the mould. Please hang in there and believe me, it gets better. Stick to your interests, believe in yourself. You deserve to be heard as much as everyone else. Reach out to those who support you (online friends count!) and practise compassion towards yourself. Treat yourself as a friend, this is the most important thing in the world. Big hugs <3
Well, if you ever feel like playing a board game on tabletop simulator, please let me and we'll give it a go! :)

I haven't played magic in ages, but luckily it is not about winning too much, but about having fun while playing. :) And in terms of playing, have you been to local board game stores? They might know places where players get together regularly. If you'd tell me the place you live in PM, I can help you look for a place. ^^

And I know what you mean by things getting harder. Just don't give it up completely, just do it when you feel like it and don't force yourself too much. There is no problem with stepping away and returning to it when you feel better. I do this as well when painting miniatures. Sometimes I do not advance for days. Sometimes all that happens when I do, is a couple of licks of paint than feel overwhelmed. There is no shame in stepping away and returning later. As long as you enjoy yourself when doing the task. 

Are you feeling better today? Is the PMDD more manageable? Or should we try and help you smile a bit more? ^^
I’m good about everything but the sleep part, I have really terrible insomnia.  Warm showers before bed, working out regularly, keeping phone down, meditation, all sorts of sleep aids, nothing ever keeps me asleep the whole night.  I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s one of my leading causes of a lot of symptoms.
Same. I hate to say it but self-medicating w/ Benadryl and staying completely sober is the only thing that keeps me sane. It does require a little bit of adulting, bc if you abuse it; it’ll give you a nasty headache. Also it’s not great for your skin.
Yo, I'm a huge non-starter. But I think I'm a bit older than you (early 30's). You know what really matters? Experience. Connection. Art. Does material wealth or superficial accomplishment matter, sifted through the sands of time? Fuck no. I bet you're funny, fun, and overall rad af. Don't be afraid to take the left-hand path.
There's no timeline to success. You're still young enough to do whatever the hell you want. The hair is bold and creative. I couldn't pull it off, but you sure can
I've come to realize that it is best to not compare yourself to others. A lot of my friends are doing much "better" than me in life. Engagements, promotions, vacations, etc. I used to get upset and wonder why I was the way I was. Recently it sort of clicked that the reasons I "want" those things is because I want to keep up with them not  because I truly want them. This simple realization triggered a huge change in my mindset. Life isn't perfect but it just feels good to know what I want and to have no fear about missing out or whatever.  Life is a crazy experience and as far as I can see we only get one go so I'm gonna do it my way. Some people might think I'm lazy or not motivated but the truth is I am motivated - just not by money or fancy things.


Anyways you seem cool and I just wanted to kind of share how I've been feeling lately. I hope it wasn't to much of a ramble and maybe it can resonate with you a bit.

Much love
Hey man...I've been in shoes similar to yours, and I know its impossible to see from where you are, but The Wheel turns always and conditions change.

Hang tight! I "blossomed late"...way late and it was perfect. You cant rush perfect! Best you dont compare yourself to others, because even the wildly successful get miserable when they do that.
Don’t compare yourself to others!! They might look like on surface level that they have it together but there’s always something under the surface they are struggling with. Everyone has their thing, don’t feel bad about yourself based on the way other people are living.
Ps. I love your hair!
Those are things that I really appreciate. It's pretty fun to make cool stuff and make friends doing it. Maybe I should be focusing more on that. You seem pretty fucking rad yourself. Thanks :) for commenting and for your perspective.
Thanks. Even when I'm not sure what direction I'm going I do like my hair :)
This was really helpful. It's hard not to compare but you're right I should focus down on what I really want. I didn't really think making this post would be so useful but it's really getting me thinking. Thanks.

Much love back at you
This is so poetically put. I'll keep on hanging, hopefully I'll bloom soon. :) thanks man. I really appreciate it
You're right, I shouldn't compare but it's a little difficult. Maybe it'll encourage me to do some new things. I'll keep in mind to be slightly nicer to myself. And thank you, my hair makes me feel better
Glad to help in any way I can. Feel free to send me a pm if you ever want to shoot the shit. Also forgot to mention that your hair is badass.
I'm happy that you have a friend like that. I'm in a similar situation where it's been 2 months since I've seen my closest friend. I bet she thinks the same about you
The glasses make you look great
I experience extreme anxiety, coupled with loneliness and isolation. *But that doesn't mean you're bad.* let me tell you something that took me ages to realize- your self image is not the same as other's image of you. I bet there are lots of people who would love to get to know you. I know I would.
Wow you are beyond beautiful. Hugs hope you start feeling better
“Like nobody really cares” I bet that’s not true.
OH WOW! YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL!!! SO BEAUTIFUL. BELIEVE YOU ME. 💛
That has to be typed all caps as I was really stunned by your face when I scrolled through your post! And that smile- breathtaking! 💯
Your eyes are hypnotizing and that smile just makes it easier to be dazed
Your eyes are GORGEOUS! I also love your hair color on you! It REALLY suits you!
Damn! Are you even wearing make up? It looks like you are not and your eye color is stunning! It is said that the eyes are the gate to the soul. Yours seems to be very deep and wise. Maybe your soul is telling you something that you are not aware of yet. Sometimes we are stuck in situations that we think are normal but don’t feel good to our soul. It’s a warning. Observe when these anxiety situations hit you. I know what I am talking about as I was, 4 years back from now, waking up at night, feeling anxious to fall asleep because I thought my heart would stop. Months later I realized those were anxiety attacks. I literally stopped breathing and woke up from it. Looking back it only happened when I was lying next to my partner. The relationship turned out to be toxic. The break up freed me from those attacks. You look like you are a strong person. So, stop holding your fears back and stop bottling them up and be brave enough to face them (or better face what causes them and tackling it full front). I know you can do it! ❤️
Hi mate. Soooo many people have anxiety and depression and go onto bigger and better things. I understand that it is lonely and isolating on occassions but lemme tell you that you are not alone. There are thousands of people sharing the same feelings as you right now so even though you are in rough seas others are right there paddling alongside you. You wilk get through it.

Clear your mind with exercise and try meditation, be honest with yourself and seek help. Start working on your life.

You are doing great. All the best friend.
Thank you so much for your kind words. I appreciate it so much!
Thank you so much!
Thank you!!
Thank you so much! That means a lot!
Thank you😭😭 I appreciate it!!
You're welcome 🌝
You deserve kindness no matter how much you feel you don't. There is never a wrong time to show compassion to yourself or others❤️
Sorry that you’re struggling, try to remember that you’re worth should have nothing to do with your appearance, you seem really friendly and kind. You also have amazing eyes as I’m sure you get told often:)
You've got amazing eyes! It wouldn't have occurred to me to think you were tired if you hadn't mentioned it. And try not to let those negative voices have too much say. You're way better and stronger than you think you are. It's much easier for you to see your flaws and imperfections than it is for you to see other people's, but I guarantee you that they're there. Remember - you are a child of the universe and have a right to be here. You're awesome, and whatever you do, you'll do a great job.
You are super beautiful. Hugs. Think of the sing just be happy by dory from finding nemo, I believe.
Two things that hopefully help out.  I used to be tired all of the time a long time ago, and then I learned that it's not really how much sleep you get that can change this, but the day-to-day *quality* of your sleep.  

Once I started a regular exercise routine and stayed with it, I never had more energy in my life.  That's because even an average lighter-impact three-day-a-week routine wears your body down just enough in order to get the greatest sleep possible.  Trust me, I've never gotten better sleep or had more energy in my life until I learned about that.  It can also drastically improve your overall mood as well, but the 'brain science' behind it all is beyond my abilities to explain in a nutshell.

And here's a little clip that I hold dear and think about whenever start heading in the direction of negative self talk that I hope you enjoy too:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BjKS1-vjPs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BjKS1-vjPs)
When you deal with negative self-talk, think of it this way: Would you talk to someone else like that? Give yourself the kindness you would give someone else. You got this.
Jesus you're gorgeous, I'm amazed lol
Try to remember then you have family and friend's with you and thinking you are a better person then you think 
You look very beautiful and friendly like a friend who laught with you all day but when you have a problem he come first to help you
If you need to talk or vent your more than welcome to message me I would love to hear you out and learn new things and who knows maybe I can give advice or help in anyway
Mind sharing some of that negative self-talk so you can have it refuted by an external source?
You have absolutely gorgeous eyes! Also, try looking in the mirror and saying at least one good thing about yourself every morning. It really helps boost self esteem.
X2
Agreed so fully to all above, and remember too, your first word there was ‘tired.’ Things suck more when tired, get some goooood soulful rest sister!
Thank you
Hey there, it’s your Uncle Ben here. Just wanted to let you know that I’m proud of you for having the courage to post this picture without censoring it.
You definitely don't look like a girl. Everyone goes through puberty differently. When your testosterone really starts being produced you'll look older. Give it a few years. Some of my friends started puberty late at age 16-17 and they're very manly looking now.

You have great hair btw.
Hey dude, you look great! Better than I did at the same age, that's for sure. You're still growing into your body and I don't have any doubts that you're going to be a damn fine gent. You've got great lips and expressive eyebrows and I think you might find that both of those stand you in very good stead in the future!
When I was your age, I was a punk with a bright pink and purple mohawk. Seriously dude, I know your self image may be suffering, but I bet you have a stellar personality. That's what matters. And I know this may sound harsh, but the opinions of your peers are *completely* inconsequential. Focus on being the best "you" you can be, and everything will fall into place. Promise.
Hey dude embrace your appearance and changing body! We all go through it, plus you look totally fine! You’ll get used to your appearance the more and more you expose yourself to your appearance/normalize how you look. 

You look great as you are, plus you have a really nice haircut! Keep your head up! Puberty sucks and really effects your perspective of yourself but take solace in the fact that you’re hitting it better than I did!
You’ve got some great lips! Take pride in that, it’s a rare quality in men.
Dude, you look like a 14 year old boy. I have seen guys in their 20s that look like you so don't worry about looking young or like a girl because you don't. Honestly, I see no reason why you should censor your pictures.
It's pretty funny for me to look at your picture, because your face looks almost the same as mine a few years ago. I'm nineteen now and I feel much better with my appearance. 
Your body is going through puberty right now. Although I don't think you look that young, if you do, I can say that you will look completely different in a year or two. 

You got stunning eyes by the way, almost piercing but not in a bad way!
Actually thought you were like, 16-17. Also, you don't look feminine at all! You definitely look better than me!
You look a ton like a young chris ulmer!
You look like 3 other guys (18, actually) I know that shop at my store and I thought this was a picture of one of them at first glance. Don’t sweat it brother, you’re absolutely masculine!!
People everytime want to mock you because they are gelouse and they are feeling week in front of you. You need to think you are perfect right now you are
I wish someone told me at 14 that I was better than I thought I was. More attractive, more on target for how I want to live, who I want to be... You’ve already got it, all you gotta do is own it. Relentlessly own it.
Thanks, uncle Ben! BTW, next family christmas it at your house, right?
Thank you! >.<

I had some people getting confused about my gender before, but now that I think about it, I guess it is just 'cause I am more cute-looking.

Also, thanks for the compliment about my hair! I already tried some different styles and I decided to stay with this one (Short on one side and a little longer on the other side). My inspiration was Skrillex. XD
Aaaaw! Thanks a LOT, mate! I never liked my eyebrows, but you're making me feel better about it, now. Again, thanks a lot! :D
Yo, you at least weren't insecure and went for a style that stands out. I always wanted to dye a part of my hair purple but I am too insecure.

And thanks a lot, I don't even know what to say, your toasting is next-level!
Aww, thanks! Y'all are making me feel better 'bout myself, I don't even know what to say!
tnx :) A lot of ppl are complimenting my lips, now I am looking at me in a different way.
That's good to ~~hear~~ read, thanks a lot!
Awww! Thanks! People always compliment my eyelashes but never something 'bout the actual eyes. :D
Wait, really? Wow, this is really cool for me! I always did think that all my friends look older and I'm the only one who doesn't but now you boosted me with confidence! Tnx!
You think so? Welp, maybe if his hair was black...
Whoa! Thank you!
Whoa, never tought 'bout that! Thanks a lot!
Absolutely! My nephew Peter’s helping me cook some of my famous rice!
I have pretty soft features myself, hit puberty late, and couldn't grow a beard until I was a 30 year old father of two.

Don't sweat it. You're a good looking kid.
I think you would look great with purple hair, my dude.
That’s great! That’s what this sub is for! A little positivity can go a long way!
I’m glad to hear it.
Serious as a hand grenade bro! I'm glad I could brighten things!
No problem
Nice!
Awww now THERE'S the smile we love to see on here. It's glowing! . That's great to hear, K. The guy is obvs being well behaved so have the confidence he is trying to treat you right.

Good luck for Wednesday! Remember, you are fabulous anyway but hoping it goes the way you want!
You look like 25!
Absolutely amazing!
37?you look like at least 24 girl!!
37? really? are you sure? you look at the most 27.

&#x200B;

you're really pretty. wishing you the best of luck on wednesday (not that you need it!)
Well for starters you accidentally hit "3" instead of "2".
Here's a signal that will always work for someone who looks like you:

"Shut up and kiss me."
Congratulations! He's probably  nervous because you have beautiful soul piercing eyes and a gorgeous smile, you know how sometimes you look at a person and just instantly know they're a good soul? Well that's you, best of luck to you on Wednesday keep up updated we'll be cheering for you!
Wow thats great! Im so happy for you! yea you seem to like each other so just be yourself and I think everything is going to be great!

Good luck! :) :) :)
Between the Beautiful eyes and gorgeous smile, he is probably nervous but ready. Go for it.
That’s an exciting development! Best of luck to you!
You look so happy! It's brightened up my day just seeing it. I wish you the very best. Oh, and I hope you make the first move. I've heard that some shyer guys find that absolutely mind-blowing.
Go with the “so are you going to kiss me yet?”
First of all I can not believe you are 37! Secondly just go for it! You'll probably blow this guy away!
You have super nice skin! Coming from a guy, he could be much more nervous than you would come to think. Sometime it's nice to hear the girl say "shut up and kiss me already". Good luck!
Nice!  Congrats!
You got this!!
20 seconds of courage is all you need! Also your smile is radiant!
Wow, you are radiant! He's very lucky to be going out with you, and to have your eye. Enjoy yourself on Wednesday and don't worry, he -wants- to kiss you, just just might be too intimidated by your beauty to make the first move, or he's just very well behaved.
You look lovely. Lucky guy.
That's one lucky guy!!!
Hell yeah! You look beautiful and youve got this!!!
You're a cutie and look like a sweetheart. I'm sure he likes you if you're on a third date. Just go for it yourself, he's probably just shy. I just started dating someone and was glad she made the first move or I'd definitely be like this guy and still wondering if it's okay to kiss her yet. Good luck!
You look great.
If you like him...go for it. His reaction will be genuine since he won't expect it. Make that move.
37? More like 27! :D I’m sure it’ll all go well, and definitely don’t be afraid to make the first move if you want to :)
Your smile is so heartwarming and lovely! You seem like such a kind and lovely person to be around. I don’t you have anything to be nervous about hun!
KISS HIM! HE'S PROBABLY JUST SHY AND NERVOUS BECAUSE YOU'RE SO PRETTY
Good on you!   


Chances are very likely he is just as nervous as you. You already have the 3rd date planned, feel confidence in that, he at the very least finds you interesting enough to keep coming back for more.   


Follow your heart and everything will turn out alright!  


And as everyone says, you look amazing, just smile and the world will be at your feet. :)
You are absolutely stunning
You’re a beautiful girl. Just flash that smile and that should be all the signals he needs. 😊
Maybe he doesn’t even need a kiss. I’m with a guy who appreciates me no matter what, and you’re absolutely stunning so I don’t know how he couldn’t see it. I’m in Toledo Ohio, if you ever want wanna talk about school ❤️
27M here and I honestly assumed you were my age until I read your caption. Don’t be afraid, go get him!
Ok.. I know it’s an odd detail to get stuck on, but your eyebrows are an amazing color. Like a sunrise or something! Truly beautiful!

Congratulations on the dates. Keep smiling, hold your head up. You’ve got this. Just be you- it’s obvious that you’re a fantastic person.
You got this!!
As someone who thought they were sending obvious signals but according to friends was not, don’t send signals.  If you want to kiss him, ask!  With a smile as gorgeous as yours, and as much as he seems to like spending time with you there shouldn’t be any problems.
You are pretty nice looking, and seem to be a super nice person, don't worry, the guy is almost certainly super into you, just go for it
When you hang out suggest watching The Little Mermaid, and when Kiss the Girl comes on give him a very meaningful. Even outside of my extreme I say go for it, you look like a lovely individual and I'm sure he'd enjoy :)
Very pretty best wishes on your third date 👍
Everyone here talks about some amazing smile? Never got that far in the image, Im still stuck looking into those eyes <3 Just wow !
You remind me of Kira the Gelfling, which is a massive compliment by the way!
Wow your eyes are like.......wooaah. A guy could get lost in them. Like travelling through space at warp speed in the millennium falcon. Eh, total nerd talk, I know. You should have no problem making the first move, OP. I bet since your last date he's been playing it out in his mind the entire time anyway. Save him the torment, show him you know what's up and lean in first.
Don’t be scared to go in for that kiss yourself :) Have a great time regardless
Your hair is absolutely stunning and the colour goes well with the colour of your eyes. And you look like you're in your twenties!
Good luck!! =)
You have a very kind smile!
Wooooow! He is really lucky to date you. You look like you are really a cute girl! Don’t be afraid to rock the boat here or there. You are awesome the way you are.
He's too memorized by those eyes to go in for the kiss. You may need to blink more to help him out.
24M and thought you were younger than me
IIIII don’t think you need any help. You just show up.
Gag him down already!
You got this, but why don't you kiss him first? Why do you have to signal him to kiss you?
Okay, this is gonna sound half-mean and I'm sorry, but if your nostrils were a little smaller, you'd be a definite 10

&#x200B;

Edit: 37?? damn
Hell yeah! Listen. With those eyes and that hair, you don't have a thing to worry about. Laugh and smile and love life, and everything will come naturally. You've got this. We're here for you. 😁
If he doesn’t wanna kiss you, I will! 😂😂😂. Seriously though, you look amazing.  As someone who gets told I don’t look ** years old there’s no way you are almost my age! 26 at tops!
just kiss him, he wouldn't care
Can confirm. My first kiss went exactly like that
mesmerized. come on, Ken
you’re very beautiful, you have a nice face and nice hair, and from what I hear you’re a pretty great person too. Keep it goin bud.
You’re a real cutie! I love your hair colour and style, you have a really nice aesthetic.
Hi there!
I'm glad I got here in time then 😉 
Loving the hair and glasses- epic style...
But more importantly- your smile has the potential to show people the sun still shines, and maybe their smile in return will remind you the same. There's a goodness in you, revel in showing that!
You're very pretty, very nice smile and hair, you kinda look like Maisie Williams but with a prettier smile :)
You pull off blue hair really, really well! :)
You have such a genuinely sweet face. You look like someone I could be close friends with.
You look amazing and I love your hair!! Be kind to yourself man!
you're all so sweet and I want to reply to everyone but I don't know what to say other than thank you, and don't want to be repetitive aaa
You’re so pretty! Your eyebrows are perfect and your hair and glasses suit you so well:) you seem really friendly and relaxed! And you’re dog is adorable btw, kind of reminds me of mine:)
You’re adorable and look very well put together (idk if that makes sense). I love the way everything about you just seems to match and I really hope you don’t delete this because it’s great ❤️
I love love love love your hair! My hair is currently purple and I’m wanting to dye it the color you have it! It’s so flattering on you! I also like your glasses! You seem to have great tastes :) I hope you’re doing well!
You look great, also your hair is amazing. The blue color suits you so well, I love it :)
You have such a sweet smile!!
But you are so cute tho ❤️ blue hair looks so good on you and I love the simple makeup look 💞 such a cutie
Uhm, HELLO BEAUTIFUL! I love your hair! And your glasses! And that button down goes so well with your hair! Your aesthetic is wonderful. We all get insecure sometimes. You’re not alone! 💙
You look beautiful, absolutely love your hair! And you have such a wonderful smile to 😄😁
Such a great username!
If your hair was reddish, you would be a dead ringer for Maisie Williams, only cuter.
You are so pretty! The hair is such a good look on you! I actually think we look kinda similar, but you can definitely rock pale skin and glasses better than I do!
Your blue hair is so chic!
In case no one told you before - You look like Maisie Williams. 

&#x200B;

I'm not even kidding! [Image](https://imgur.com/a/mLPatDj)
Love your hair!
I love your eyebrows and shirt !! 
Those glasses too!! You seem like a girl I’d try and be friends with IRL.  
I hope you have a lovely day ☺️
❤️
Insecure? Not often we see someone with a total true sense of style. Just put that out there with your show stopping smile. You will truly transform people’s moods and make their day- whether they say something or not.
You have an adorable smile.

Your eyebrow game is *strong*.

I like the colour of your hair.
Keep it, it's a really flattering pic
Forever wishing I had eyebrows like yours 😍
I fricking love your hair!
Best user name in all of reddit op
from your hair and eyebrows and makeup i can tell you put a lot of effort into your appearance, and its paying off because you look like a very cool and interesting person and if i saw you in public i’d want to be your friend
Hey beautiful you don’t need to delete anything. Your smile killed each and everyone of us. You are breathtaking
Your eyebrows are great and you have a kind face. 💜
You have a very pretty smile and I love your hair!
Brow game killing it
You are beautiful. I know it can be hard leaving photo up but it is a step forward when you do. Hugs hope all goes well
Your style is amazing; the blouse hair combo snap, crackles and pops. Not to mention you have the cutest face.

Beyond that though your love for Tank is amazing, what a lucky dog to have someone like you that loves them so much.
I am loving your style and especially your hair! You are rocking that look so well. Side question: how do you get your lashes to look so incredible?
Hey you look really nice. I like the smile on you lips. But this haircolour it's awesome. I wish I had the straight to change my haircolour. 
I wish you a good day (hopefully your day just starts because mine ends in a few minutes) what I want to say is that I wish you a great time. Make the best out of every moment.
You are so stunning. I hope you have a great week <3
you are absolutely precious wtf!!!! -heart eyes-
You look like the kind of girl who would make a great friend. (I’m a fairly straight girl, so I usually evaluate girls based on whether I think they’d make a good friend.) You just look so kind and pretty and smart. You look like the type of girl I would confidently set my male friends up with.
You have the cutest hair I’ve ever seen, it complements your face so well! Keep rocking girl, you’re beautiful
There's no reason at all to be insecure when you're gorgeous. Your smile is radiant, your hair looks amazing, and you have a wonderful complexion. You are the epitome of feminine beauty. Don't let your inner demons get the best of you, and have a wonderful day!
You’re so gorgeous! You look like Maisie Williams!
Your smile makes me smile.
I love your hair it’s so pretty! That blue looks good on you!
You’re so cute!!
You are ROCKING that blue hair. I am so jealous!! Very creative and very cute :) You rock!!
You look a lot like Arya from GoT
ur hairs my new fave colour and your username is the best
Your picture simply makes me feel happy.
The hair is absolutely gorgeous, but the true gem here is your smile. You made me smile just by making me look at this picture.
You have a wonderful smile and I love your glasses. You look very cute!
You look like Arya Stark of Winterfell.
That hair is aewsome
Ok, I have a lot to say so I’m just gonna go for it: Ok, so first of all you are amazing at colour coordinating. Your skin tone, hair colour, top, and lip colour all go together PERFECTLY. Btw, if you’re wearing a lip product - what is it?? I love it! You have such a gorgeous lip shape and eye shape (ngl I’m jealous) and you apply makeup really nicely!! I also love your cheeks, they make me happy! You seem like someone I would want to approach and be friends with. Lastly, YOUR HAIR. Oh my gOD I gasped. It’s amazing! It reminds me mostly of a soap by Lush called “[Outback Mate](https://www.lush.ca/en/shower/bar-soap/outback-mate/06057.html)” that I always love seeing because I think it’s so cool looking and beautiful. Also, the “[Sea Vegetable](https://www.lush.ca/en/shower/bar-soap/sea-vegetable/00079.html)” one, but moreso the first one. Additionally, it reminded me of Owl City’s “The Midsummer Station” album, which surprised me as thinking about it now, the “Ocean Eyes” is probably closer colour wise. Anyways, I’m super jealous !! You have a perfect gradient going on and strong colour payoff. I hope you have a great day and feel better soon !!!
Your hair looks really good! Did you do it yourself or professional because the color is so even and your hair barely looks damaged!
I like your hair and glasses. You have a great sense of style. They also flatter your eyes.
You look like a modern sort of pinup girl.  I am so digging the hair and bangs and the glasses.   And after digging through your posts, I can say you are pretty awesome with confidence.  I also love your dog.  He is a handsome boy.
You are really cute. I like you
Love your hair! Definitely suits you. Wish I could rock all blue.
Oml you're such a freakin cutie. As a coloured hair gal myself, I was once told that I'm a very original person. And I'm definitely saying the same to you!! Also be brave enough to be yourself :))
You are absolutely gorgeous, my dear! Believe it, it helps others to see it better😊
Fantastic aesthetic, keep slaying queen
i love your hair !! you’re rly pretty <3
u look nice
You have the exact hairstyle I want. I’ve literally saved your photo so I can go to the hairdresser and ask her to make me as beautiful as you in time for my birthday. Thanks! 💕
you're so cute! you have a really nice face and you somehow look good in bangs. Your eyebrows are actually amazing. is it weird to say you have nice hands? eh whatever. you have nice hands. and your username is so funny.
Your hair is amazing, and you're really pretty!
You have the cutest cheeks 🥰
You are BEAUTIFUL!!! I LOVE your aesthetic/style. Eyebrows are on point, hair is amazing, the glasses look so great on you (I’m jealous cause I need glasses but can never pull them off) and you have a super cute smile! Love yourself xx
I just need to point out that your hair is the absolute BEST SHADE OF BLUE.
Where do we even start! 
Those glasses frames are killer 
They eyebrows - flawless
I’d kill to be able to rock a sweet hair color like that! 
Get it girl!
You have a beautiful smile, and your hair colour is gorgeous!
Best username I saw this month
Such a great aesthetic! Loooove the glasses and hair! If I saw you in the street I’d be jealous of you js
I think you have a beautiful face and my son says you have cool hair!
You have such a beautiful face! Porcelain doll vibes
I have blue hair too! That's why you're cool :)
Your brows are perfect and your glasses are exceptionally well-suited to your face!!
Your eyebrows are perfect!
You have a great choice in glasses.
I love your hair and your haircut!
your skin looks really well cared for it. I just watched like eight makeup tutorials that say if you have great skin the rest of it's easy. I do not have great skin.
You are absolutely adorable!!
I love your hair, I wish mine looked as good as that back when I dyed it!
Love your username!

EDIT: seriously it always makes my day when I see a post from a creative username. 🏏🥋🤺🤹‍♀️🎬🎲🧩🎰
Blue is a good choice.
(I was going to edit my og comment but i cant find it so im reposting it, oof.)
Blue, great choice!
*cheesy joke here*
You literally have the perfect face! Beautiful smile, hair color, brows 🥰 please know you are not alone 😉
I like eggs too
I love your hair!!! And you have a super cute smile! Those glasses are adorable, eye brows look great, and I want your shirt!! Haha
I love your hair and glasses!!! They go so well together :)
IlliterateEgg on Toast? 
What are you insecure about? McDonalds wanting to steal your user name?
Breaking the internet cuteness meter?

Well, cheers!🥂😻😻😻
Sorry for all caps but I LOVE YOUR FACE YA CUTIE
You look like such a sweet kind person.
I’m so jealous of those glasses! I don’t have the right face for those. The hair, the glasses, makeup, everything. I love it! ❤️
No no! Don't delete it! Holy goodness you are so pretty and you look like a porcealine doll my dear. You look like such a kind and genuinely good person
You are cute as a button I love your style :)
You seem so sweet, and your hair and  makeup is gorgeous! You’re totally the kind of person my socially awkward, shy ass would see in public and go “she seems nice, i’ll sit next to her!”, which I think is the best kind of person.
You’re extremely cute and beautiful. I love your hair and your smile :)
Blue hair suits you
I really liked it when you murdered Walder Frey and his family. Also, that slick knife trick when you stick the Night King was bitchen.
Great smile, very cute
Your hair is cute af
Heyy! You're beautiful! And I'm not saying that just for the sake of making you feel good! It's a fact ❤ I love your hair! You sure do rock it! Matches with your blouse too haha! And you glasses, it perfectly suits your face!! You come across as someone who's friendly, gentle, approachable, and kind. 

Love, I wish you could take your insecurities and completely do away with them. From what I see, they have no reason to stay. You're beautiful and you're worthy to be seen in the best light possible. 💛
Love the blue hair. I think you look adorable.
I am late but you are rocking that hair and you have a lovely smile!
I think that your eyebrows are ridiculously and well sculpted. also, I really like how your hair frames your face into a heart shape. Way to go, you classy broad!
Pardon me for making assumptions, but you definitely seem like the quirky type, not rawr xd quirky, but like actually quirky in an enjoyable and wholesome way
You are so cute, and I bet you can read, too!

I love that big eyebrows are back. When I was a teenager, we were all trying to get them pencil-mark skinny. But I loved the movie Pretty Woman...man...Julia Roberts had caterpillars on her face! You've found a nice, shaped, seductive medium.
Don’t delete it, you’re the CUTEST!
You’re so pretty, I love your hair and style, and your skin is amazing! You also look like one of those people that is so nice that it literally shows on their face at all times
Love the glasses, they really go with the rest of your adorableness
Omg no like lowkey you're whole aesthetic is on point, like, blue hair/its length, shaped eyebrows, glasses, and all. Like for real even if you hadn't posted a toast I would have commented that just so you know.
You have a very pretty smile :)
I love your hair.
I find you really cute ^^
Your hair and shirt match. That's pretty epic.
Your hair color looks great on you. Your one of the few people who picked a color that suits them well!
Ramona Flowers is that you?
I love that hair. Metal vibes <3 Feel my pain lol its hard to pull that color with a brown skin tone :(
Gorgeous with a don’t give a shiv expression. Keep killing it girl!
I love your username!!! It made me giggle :) Also your eyebrows are really well done, you look great! Have a wonderful night :)
You're cute. Keep spreading love, the world needs more love.. the world is better when you're in it!! It's good to be insecure! Too many egotistical cunts around! Love you <3
That lipstick color looks great on you!

I like your hair. Blue is very pretty.
You have a really cute smile :)
Your haaaair! 😍😍😍
I absolutely adore your hair!
Holy shit, you’re frickin gorgeous and I love your style!
You look easy to become friends with.
Your username doesn't reflect anything negative about you. In fact, illiterateegg makes you sound funny and creative.

:)
Cute. Sassy. Sense of fashion. There is absolutely nothing wrong with you. Stay strong, trust your heart, and tell that voice that doesn't like you to go fuck itself. You're awesome. 💪
Your hair cut and colour looks so beautiful on you!!! 💓💓💓

ily pal
Thank you so much!!
I was about to say the same thing
Thats true
Came here to say this. I agree, you look like a genuinely kind soul.
no harm in being polite :)
Thank you! My dog is an angel and sometimes just as much as a derp as yours ((:
Lots of curling, plus mascara and falsies! I get mine from House of Lashes (:
Hi, thank you so much for all of this!! I use the Gloss Bomb by Fenty Beauty 😄
I did it myself!
Thank you!! Happy cake day (:
what
Hey dude, I appreciate you taking time out of your obviously very busy life to comment, but you're in the wrong subreddit. Troll elsewhere (:
Do we mean "I hope never more for you to post your face as I don't want to look at it" or "I wish you the speediest recovery of confidence that you never more need for Toastme, being the walking embodiment of the sub? “


P. S. The 2nd one is the correct one... 🤫
not sure what the intention with this comment was
Please no advice, comment removed. Thanks!
Hey! Thank you for the concern, I really just need a haircut. My hair is generally well taken care of and overall pretty soft, I just don't have the money to get it cut and don't want to try to do it myself (:
You're in the wrong subreddit, dude.
You're in the wrong subreddit.
Love them! I’ve never been great at the art of make-up but I do like to wear a little mascara from time to time so I’ll definitely have to look into getting a curler and maybe trying out some falsies. Thank you for sharing!
I never would’ve noticed wow!
U dont watch game of thrones?
nope!
U look like one of the protagonist, Arya stark.
You are stronger than your addictions. You deserve happiness. You will get through this.
I'm proud of you. I hope you know that we are all rooting for you. Remember to replace bad habits with good ones and to have fun doing new healthy things. Running is a great way to clear our heads, I highly recommend you run in the woods when you feel that your head is too crowded. You can start of with just 15 minutes. For me it helps the most to sprint as fast as I can and get the adrenaline going.
Edit: post was sent to Automod queue and authorising mod was blind and missed the verification. Much shame🤦‍♂️. Have an upvote 


You are taking a massive step with the recovery and rehab. Much respect, pal. You are a fighter and don't forget it.
Aw c/mon man you'll be alright. Try meditation to calm your mind.
as someone who struggles with intrusive thoughts as well, just try to be as patient as you can with yourself. it’s overwhelming to constantly have to battle with yourself, but just know that it doesn’t mean that there’s anything inherently wrong with you. fighting for your inner peace is difficult, but as you slowly reach that point, you will feel even more accomplished than you would ever think possible. just know that you are fully capable of reaching happiness, i undoubtedly believe that you will get there <3
you are an incredibly strong person for staying clean. I have been off the pills for nine years. the first months were a bit hard but after that everything settled and it's the best thing I have ever done in my life.
you got this mate!
You go bro, it ain't easy getting clean but it's worth it, kick that addiction s butt, you got this admitting to an addiction is the first step towards recovery, if you need someone to talk to during those trying times, chat me up! Good luck we're all cheering for you, you're strong!
Hey there friend, glad you are here and reaching out for support and kindness. You have a kind face, and I get a "cool nerd" vibe from you, like you'd be fun to play D&D with or to debate with. And you really pull off those round eyeglass frames, not a lot of people can.

Also for whatever it worth: Know that your thoughts and feelings are not always truth, and you can acknowledge and accept them without giving in to them. Please find ways to take care of and be kind to yourself, even if it's only little things, despite whatever those thoughts are telling you to do or feel.
Hey man it’s all good, beating an addiction when you’re young will make the rest of your life seem just a tad easier (remembering this time). I just about went back to pills after 3 and 1/2 months this week end! Relied on my parents heavily, I’d recommend the same! And therapy if not yet!
I'm going to try to address everything in your post, but I'm scatterbrained so forgive me if I fail. When I was 20, I too felt crushed, and had a crippling heroin addiction. So I get it dude. My head is still crowded with anxiety, self doubt, and fear. Fwiw I'm in my 30's now. Let me tell you what I wish somebody told me when I was your age. *it gets harder, but it gets better too.* fuck society. Fuck their expectations. Live for yourself. Do what you want. There is no other point in life. I bet you are a creative and smart individual. Fuck the rabble, be yourself, and be yourself *hard.*
IT is hard, but you are STRONGER than that. Every person who beats this makes the rest of us stronger!
Unfortunately, happiness doesn't come on it's own when you go clean, but staying clean opens up every possibility of achieving happiness. You took the step to put the pills away and that shows that you have the strength to stay away. Just let it take its time! And hey, you've got the rest of your life to find your happiness, so hang in there! :)
Congratulations for going clean after pill addiction. You make the impression like you are a very sensitive maybe extremely empathic person. Maybe meditation would help to focus more. In the beginning it is about focusing on your breathing. I started with some YouTube videos on meditation and it has helped me through some crazy parts in my life. Check YouTube for ‘guided meditation’. If I look at your picture, I can see you being a western guru of tomorrow, once you mastered the meditation skill and once you dive deeper into these topics.
thank you so much <3
thank you so much, this advice is really meaningful and i think its going to be helpful <3
ah sorry, forgot to reverse the image!

thank you so much <3
:) thank you so much. i really ought to try it

its true, im so glad that i have wonderful parents that are able to help me out <3
omg no worries re: addressing everything in the post. this is such a meaningful message, i cant believe how inspiring and kind everyone is being. congratulations on beating your addiction <3
thank you so much <33
In fairness I get put off when I GET THEM the right way round, so developed is my reverse image read. It was just a little off to the side but caught myself just after!

All the best pal. Don't let anyone shake u
no problem :’-) just know if you need anyone to reach out to, ill be here to listen.
You're welcome! Hope you are well.
Hey dude I want to say that recovery from addiction is a lifelong process. But it's *your* process. My sobriety is different from yours which is different from hers from his and so on. If you can get out while you're young, I salute you. And if it takes longer, I forgive you ♥
:D
hey likewise! thank you again
Boy you better stop, you cute :)
You have beautiful eyebrows! And a lovely thick head of hair.

Facial asymmetry isn't always obvious to other people, and it doesn't mean you aren't attractive, take Bradley Cooper for example.

You deserve a wonderful, happy and successful life and I believe in you.
You look handsome
Lighten up on yourself buddy! Your a handsome man! Doing hell of a lot better than I did at 19. Focus on your schooling and don’t let life get you down! Your special someone is out there waiting for you somewhere. 

Keep doing what your heart tells you and don’t let doubt deter you from the great things I know you can accomplish.
I simply cannot believe how people see themselves.  Everyone else sees a handsome guy with beautiful thick hair- and you’re obviously bright- the world is your oyster.  Here is the best advice I ever received- some 40 years ago-and it applies now more than ever: if you want to feel good about yourself, you need to do things you can feel good about.  Focus on that, the rest will follow.
Dude, you have great, thick hair and some pretty damn good looking eyebrows! I think you have a very good face shape and you should definitely be more confident about your looks!

I promise that you can get through these things. You’ve made it to college which is great!!! Keep going and enjoy every minute of the journey. 

I’m rooting for you man!
You look great! You're eyebrows.. literally goals lol

Keep your head up!
Dude most people dont have a symmetrical face, doesnt mean youre not a good looking guy lol

And also you got some nice hair man, i wish mine looked like that

Rock on man, you got this
There are many, many women who don’t care about a man’s height. This whole “over 6ft” trope is bullshit. 

What matters is who you are, and you sound like a terrific person. 

No one’s face is symmetrical, but as a stranger when I first saw this pic I didn’t notice/think anything about asymmetry, I looked straight at your eyes, they are amazing!

Edit: and those eyebrows!!!
You have some Noah Centineo vibes going on!
Facial asymmetry? Boy, I wish I looked that good when I was your age. As far as height goes, a lot of that is in your mind. I'm 5' 7" (on a good day) but it's never held me back from anything.
Boy oh boy, you're handsome!!! If only you can see what we're seeing! 💛
Thank you all so much for your kind words!!! I just joined this sub last night and the response has blown me away! I think it was the right choice. The best things I can do right now are to keep working for myself and to dive into this amazing community with all my heart. I hope I can keep it going :)
Right back at ya :)
Thank you so much, I needed to hear this. I wish you all the happiness in the world😊
Thank you 😊
Thank you. Let's hope I can keep moving forward :)
I'm feeling better already. Thank you 😊
I second this!!! 💯
it's actually kind of a good thing when someone leaves you because now you have room for someone who ACTUALLY loves you to come in. You look like a nice and handsome guy, so I'm sure you'll do just find meeting someone! Keep your head up! :)
Dude I got my philosophy degree and then got my masters in public policy. It’s not a shit degree, great foundation but I do recommend going back to school. FYI: if it sounds daunting, go to Europe for your masters. Cheaper, quicker, and less barriers to enroll (no shitty GMAT). I’m assuming you’re American.

try to be thankful. You realized she wasn’t a genuine person to you. You look young. You have your whole life ahead of you. I’m excited to hear about your new gf in Europe ;)
You are a really handsome guy. You have lovely, big eyes and you have good facial structure. 

I am so sorry for the loss and heartbreak you must be suffering through now. But please remember that what she did is a reflection on her and not you. You can now find someone who actually loves and cares about you. It could take time but I promise that there is someone out there who will make you forget about what happened and make you feel loved.

Your dog is adorable by the way and I am sure he is very lucky!
What a lucky pup! 8 years is quite a long time, and I’d imagine things might be a bit uncertain for a little while. What I’m seeing though, is a young, handsome, college educated bachelor with a sweet pup by your side. Im sure you have a bright future ahead of you even if you can’t see it. Best of luck to you my man ❤️
Your dog is adorable and well loved, and your nose piercing suits you very very well. 8 years is ages and I’m very sorry for your loss of time- but it also heals all wounds or whatever (I’m sure you’re wiser than me with that degree). One goal is enough to stay afloat as far as I’m concerned ♥️
The end of a relationship is always hard to deal with, so don’t beat yourself up about finding things difficult. 

Think of it this way: your life is a film, and you’re at the start of a new scene after the previous scene ended dramatically. You don’t know yet what’s going to happen in this new scene, other than during it your heartache inevitably declines. But you can make the scene better to live through or worse to live through by the choices you make about the storyline. Choose well. (Or don’t. You’re young and single, there’s no better time to make crazy choices. But choose *something*.

Secondly, your degree is not worthless. Clear and logical thinking is valued by many employers, and it will make you a better employee. Getting a more specialist postgraduate qualification will help if you would like a career in a particular speciality, but it’s not essential. 

Finally: looks aren’t everything, but you’re clearly a good looking guy. Out there in the world is the next love of your life. Go gettem!
I promise you it will get better.
Your dog is adorable and wants you to be successful :)
Hang in there bro, like people say as one door closes another one opens and dont think of your relationship ending as a bad thing, she wasnt your soulmate she was there to prepare you before you go on to meet her one day soon, hope life picks up for you m8 and your god has always got your back remember that
 Not a lot of people can rock a nose ring but it looks so sick on you. Any lady would be luck to have you!
My friend has a 4 year philosophy degree and he works for the county making pretty solid money. Philosophy teaches employable skills, no matter what STEM people say. You can break down issues into smaller parts and reconstruct them in ways others cannot. Critical thinking is a skill. Putting complex cause and effect scenarios into clear writing is a skill. Quick thinking, agile mentality, and an understanding of schemas, tropes, signs, etc....these are things people will pay for. Things a machine will not replace any time soon. People who major in philosophy and literature, my best professor ever once said, major in INDETERMINACY. Market your mind. Your education has value. Also, sometimes "destroy and rebuild" can be extremely cathartic. Hang in there man. You got this.
Okay, let me be a little superficial first. You are VERY handsome and I mean that seriously, not just saying it to cheer you up. If I saw you walking down the street, I'd probably find it hard to walk normally and not look at you type of handsome lol.

Now I'm really sorry about what happened. Even though, as others said - it is good she "let you go" NOW cause if she left for another guy, she would have probably left later anyway - it still doesn't erase the pain. You'll feel down for a while and it will suck, eight years is a long time, but after you get through the hard part, it's done. You just have to hang on. It gets easier day by day. Just remember it's essential to feel the emotions now so you can live free later. 

I hope you (and your sweet little doggo) will have beautiful times ahead. With or without a new girlfriend, give it time and don't stress about it. Try out some new hobbies, do something you've always wanted to do, hangout with friends etc. Anything to pass the time.

My inbox is always open (for you and for anyone needing). Hope my butchered English made some sense at least.

All the best for you!
They didn't leave you after 8 years, you gained 8 years of experience to find the actual one!
Your pup is absolutely adorable and so are you. Don’t let a breakup wear your spirits down, I promise it’s only uphill from here. Just focus on the positives ahead, like getting a kick-ass degree!
You’re above average looking for sure. You’re smart enough to have graduated college. In context of the world, you are probably in the richest 5% of people on the planet. Ending relationships can be hard, but the best way to move on from one is to strengthen your most important relationship, the one with yourself. 

Don’t tell yourself all the bad stuff you’ve done, start with the good stuff. Don’t get too down on yourself, love yourself man. You deserve to be happy, but only you can do it for yourself.
You look totally attractive and probably a good conversationalist with a complicated degree and all!
You’re going to be okay. 8 years is a long time, but let’s not assume things we don’t know because that’s illogical and it will hurt you more to ruminate on something that probably isn’t true. I believe that you can find your passions and make them your reality, but you need to begin by exploring them. Go to meetup (it’s a site and an app) and anything you see that remotely interests you that you haven’t tried, go do and see if you like it. It doesn’t mean you’re not successful if you’ve never tried something, it means you fear settling so you need to do some exploring. Don’t fall into the pitfalls of nihilism. You’re meant to do something great , and all you need to do is sit down and plan out each individual step and time of when you are going to achieve them. Also, I’m envious of your nose ring because I would like to pull one off but I don’t see it happening lol.
You're handsome and smart and a dog lover. There is a huge market for people like you! Philosophy isn't worthless!!! You aren't either friend.
Good skin, full facial hair, and a great taste in canine companionship. I think physically, you're great.
I felt like this really recently, like I had nothing to look forward to in life so what was the point? Just take one goal at a time, the rest will follow. If your dog is all you got right now, it’s a damn good place to start. All the best :)
Dodged a bullet, your lucky. Make the most of it!!!
You are worth way more than that other guy, she left because she saw all your worth and it was too much for her. You. Are. Appreciated. Much love
You're super cute and personally, I'd be into a guy with a philosophy degree.
It all takes time, friend, and it'll be hard. Take the time and space to grow despite the hurt, because you deserve so much more in life. In the meantime, we're all here for you and rooting for you! You're adorable, deep, and intelligent, and you've got a lot of great worldly experiences to look forward to :)
For what it’s worth I have a Philosophy degree and a successful career in tech where I regularly get compliments on my writing - all those philosophy papers will pay off eventually!  Also you are a very good looking dude with a cute snuggly dog, things are going to work out for you professionally and in your love life.  Sometimes life just has to jolt you a bit to move you forward to the next phase.
I’m not gay but you’re easily a 10/10, godDAWM you’re handsome as fuck
A lot of my friends from law school had undergrad philosophy degrees. If you think critically about text, you can be a great lawyer!
My uncle is a very successful philosophy professor. That’s not a worthless degree. You have very pretty and kind eyes. Your puppy looks perfect. Things will work out, honey. There wouldn’t be rainbows if it were not for rain. Keep being awesome.
Well hey at least you know your dog will always love you! Sometimes they make better friends than people because they’ll give you unconditional love ❤️
You truly are a handsome man, and I love your dog (looks like a German Shepherd, I have one too!). Take the time to find a new hobby, travel, and develop a better love for yourself! You have our support and I can’t wait to see what adventures you and your fur baby embark on!
you're a cute guy
One: you crochet. Which is fucking awesome in and of itself. 

Two: you’re a deep thinker, as evidenced by your philosophy degree. 

Three: you have a dog. And you love him/her. +100 points automatically. 

Four: you’re very attractive, and I have no doubt you can find someone else very easily. 

You’ve got this. You’re full of awesome.
Maybe I’m seeing something here that is neon. 8 years and you refer to her as your live in gf? Perhaps she needed a stable progressive life and that wasn’t it. I don’t blame her for moving on, regardless of who or what you are.  She obviously wanted what you didn’t have to offer. That being said, move on, focus on your degree, job, life. The right person will cross your path.
Couple things, mate. You got your health and your pups health. You may be down but you’re not out, and philosophically speaking, she may have been a very important part of your life, but she is not your entire ontology.  Get your degree; do it for you and keep moving along until you find your purpose. You got this.
You have a dog that loves you more than anything, and more importantly you have a reset in your life. It will hurt like hell for a while but this is still a good opportunity to fill your life up with goals, dreams, and ambitions. Be the man your dog k ows you are!
The same thing happened to me (on a smaller scale but still) my girlfriend left me for another dude it's been about 6 months since then and I found someone even better and she's still alone... Just remind yourself that it will always get better no matter how bad it gets. Good luck man 👍
Dude get that philosophy degree then go travel! If you have a bachelor's you can teach English in many places outside of the US. You can make good money in Vietnam for example and get a chance to see the world. I traveled after my live in gf dumped me and it helped me a lot. I realized I can do very exciting and interesting things on my own. Plus you're very attractive so finding another that loves you for you is easy once you feel better within and love yourself. Don't you compare yourself to whatever dick she might be with and focus on the love that is waiting for you to be open to it. 

I'd say, if you are into it, plan to go somewhere new once you graduate. Reward yourself for your hard work by taking a break and seeing something that amazes you because this world is amazing and there's no shortage of awe inspiring experiences to be had!! 
❤
You are very attractive, and my biggest crush was was a super hot philosophy professor, so don’t say the degree is worthless! BTW, who is your favorite philosopher?
You look like a nice guy, and I trust a dog's judgement so you can't be too bad. What's their name? Also, I can kinda see that you have a tattoo so that's cool too! I really like your facial hair, too, and I think that's sometimes hard for guys to pull off but you do it well.
You are ROCKING that nose ring! Sorry to hear about the end of a relationship. Give yourself time to grieve, but don't lose hope. We live in a giant world with lots to live for ♥️ Also side note you've got gorgeous hair and eyes
i love you!!! in the years to come you will succeed further than ever before
My Sociology degree was "useless" until I learned how to market it in my new field. Everything is a transferable skill and how you connect your studies to your job is key.

For example, I used the Milgram Experiment as a reference in a major study with one of the top amusement parks. I nerded out so hard :)

You got this. You got puppy. You got a degree. You got a nice face. It's all daunting now, but "it won't be like this all the time"!

(Saw that last line on some street art yesterday and it really stuck with me.)
Keep that handsome chin up. As you know, life is full of disappointments. They make the great times so much sweeter. You have a lot going on for you! I read a lot of your comments that you made to people in this post, and you seem like a super sweet guy. Keep loving on that dog. This too will pass. Good luck to you!
I know this may sound kind of hollow but it's true, it does get better. 8 years is a long time to spend with someone, but if that person can just walk away from 8 years like that then it was never meant to be in the first place. And your degree is far from useless. in the world we live in today, we need more great minds thinking about big ideas rather than small minds thinking about the same thing everyone else does.
I’ll echo others who point out that your degree is far from worthless. It’s teaching you how to think well. And that’s a skill set in high demand. Public policy. Jurisprudence. Leadership development. Business ethics. You have a lot of great options. Just don’t forget what got you curious about philosophy to start with. That curiosity will never let you down. 

And you’ve got a great dog!
As someone going through something pretty similar man I know you can do it. Itll be hard and it's not like you'll be able to make feelings disappear but you have to work on yourself. Which I know wont be a problem because it seems you got your head on straight with you and that cute dog of yours. Also dude your pretty good looking so you got one foot in the door
Bruh. I feel ya. My wife left me after 10 years with some dude she met on the Xbox. That was 10 months ago. Still not over it. I just retired from the service and have no clue what I want to be when I grow up...

So I was tossing around the idea of strippers and coke 😆 just kidding, but it does sound fun. Every day is a struggle, but I make it through. With the support of the 5 dogs, 2 cats, and a ferret she left me with.

I'm not trying to one up you on the pity train, just letting ya know you're not alone in this.
But you have a dog that loves you and cuddles you and dogs are a good sign of character so you must be a great person
You’ve got a nice evangelion tattoo going for you!!!
You can get into many many graduate programs with your “just a philosophy degree!”
A philosophy degree makes for interesting and intelligent conversation. There are niche jobs out there where you can put it to good use!
You are a BABE. 🖤
You seem to be a deep soul and, if she picked the other dude for success or other superficial stuff, she was obviously not the right one for you. I know you will find a woman that appreciates you deepness and who shares the same views. Once you have found your way and stopped getting distracted by doubts that what gives you joy could not be attractive or so... 😉
She's got no idea what she's missing, man. You got looks, you got a thinking mind, and you got a heart of gold. Focus on being your best self. If someone wants to walk out of your life, and they can't bother to see all the good you have in you, let them walk. You gotta live your best life whether it's what everyone else wants or not. Stay strong my friend 💪 I know it hurts, but you can do this. Better days will come.
Getting over from something like that will take time and time only. Just remember not to mask your emotions and deal with them as you see fit, naturally avoid heavy drinking/other substances.

&#x200B;

Few facts:

\- You´re handsome, there´s no denying that (no homo lol)!

\- Your dog is loyal to you and as it happens to be, you have the most beautiful breed in the world -> a man of good taste !

\- None of the degrees are worthless.. None. It becomes worthless if you don´t use it correctly or continue your studies.

\- Come to Finland and continue your studies here, i believe that we are one of the best "educational" countries there is. 

\- Now you "know" at least one person from here so what are you waiting for !

&#x200B;

You may PM me if you need more information about possible studies here :)
You look like a normal chill dude, at least you have that awesome dog. Does the dog still have your back? Of course! Because you deserve it.
Thanks guy, it’s actually the first time in many years I’ve felt somewhat attractive. Sometimes relationships devolve into fear of losing your partner and subtle insults out of insecurity. Never been more confident in appearance, but damn the timing.
Ya know this has a really nice appeal to it, and I hear they removed the quarantine on pets a couple years back. Sometimes big goals like this help, thank you.
Thanks bud, this mindset works when I can stick with it. I’ve been through 8 years of foster care, 8 years juve, and now 8 years with my ex. Just gotta start the next scene, I get you, thank you.
Fact !
This is actually something I’ve been thinking about after some advice from this post. I’ve stayed dormant for so long and I think it’s restricted my views, yet I think I like this as a goal. Thank you so much for your positive words.
Also there's quite a bit you can do with a philosophy degree, I think it gets a bad rap (at least in the media) but I have a couple friends who are philosophy majors and are using it as a jumping point for other endeavors (law school, med school for psychiatry, research in human behavior/psychology)
No don’t worry sometimes it’s nice to normalize my situation. Self loathing can be cathartic for a time until it festers too long and becomes dangerously un-empathetic when you no longer are able to see outside yourself. Thank you for that, it’s refreshing to hear other people make it work.
Damn that’s some nice observation skills, maybe rewatching that show right after the breakup wasn’t the healthiest move but it was refreshing lol.
Every time something really shitty happens to me, I try to change up my environment. I moved to Europe as an American last year. If you have any questions, PM me. You can do it!
One of my best bids and highly respected auditor in my work has a philosophy degree. Really useful and great degree.
I think you missed the part where I said I retired from the service? Small words work better for me. Monosyllabic even 😆

The best advice I have is: Get out there. Do your thing. Have fun and just enjoy the day one at a time.
As cliche as it is, it will get better
Thankfully you aren’t in Shinji’s position!!! But take your time to do things you enjoy. Remember to reward yourself for the small things. You’re doing great!
Wait, can I PM you?
Haha yeah sorry sometimes when I drink I subconsciously talk a tiny bit pretentious, and you do the same bud, I appreciate it.
I don't know what you consider a binge, or what you're binging with, but it's probably not healthy, and not helping the healing process. If it's alcohol, take it in moderation. Go out with friends, or acquaintances and become friends, have a few drinks, *responsibly*, and just enjoy it.
Oh fuck you freaked me out for a second cause my dogs name is Shinji and I was a little concerned for my safety lmao
Sure
I feel you, it’s a vice ive been cutting back on, me and my ex used to be heavy drinkers but it’s less appealing alone lately so it’s getting better
ok just to clarify my god awful formatting was thanks to mobile

but also, you've got a great sense of humor if you've named your dog shinji lol
That's good to hear. Already moving on 👍
That is a killer beard, man! I have to say, this post has made my day.

The amount of courage and willpower it took to quit smoking and drinking while going to therapy and trying new things simultaneously is really, really admirable. 

I hope you continue down the right path man. You’re definitely heading in the right direction :)
Congrats on everything my man! Here's the thing about cig - they're the hardest to quit. However, in another couple months you get this reverse mindset where you see one and immediately say "how the hell did I do that?... nasty". 

And nice beard.
Hey, you're rocking a killer beard and you made it through the worst of a horrible depression. It sounds also like you're trying a lot of different things to improve your life and that's only a good thing. Keep it up, friend, and good things will only follow!
That’s awesome. You’re looking good, healthy and relaxed. Things are going to be good.
sounds like you are finding your slice of happiness. good on you my friend. the unknown is always a bit of a mystery but that is life to be experienced.
Love the beard! 😍 You look so handsome and it looks like you’re on a good path, my friend. Keep it up!
You’re on the right track. Having quit at least two addictions, you’ve shown you have a lot of strength. The road out of depression isn’t a straight one; when the going gets tough remember your inner strength
Good job buddy for fighting and putting you vices behind you. You are already on your way to recovery. Cheers to you!
Easiest toast yet when everything you're doing is fxing awesome
Way to go man. That feeling of hope is your reward for all the positive choices you're making. Good job.
Keep at it man! You're looking good!
You’re doing awesome! You are tackling multiple, extremely difficult things all at once, and you’re killing it! You’ve got this 😊 you’re also extremely handsome 😊
I don't know you but I'm so very proud of you and excited for you. These kind of life changes can be daunting before we do them but once you find the rhythm it gets easier and easier. I hope you have all the success and I'm rooting for you. 

Also your beard is fantastic😍 and you should totally post on r/beards you would be well received over there too.
Omg that is awesome to hear, I'm proud of you for stepping up!! It's a long and hard journey so go easy on yourself, alright? You should be proud, keep it going!!
Btw you have such a great beard
You're really cute! I know that attractiveness is a shallow thing to comment on, and in the grand scheme of things doesn't hold much worth, but it sounds like you’re also creating a really solid foundation with your lifestyle choices as well. I know it’s hard now— I wouldn’t wish depression on my worst enemy— but I know you’ll look back on this time with triumph once you’re happier than ever. People are lucky to know you!
There is this moment (actually a lot of moments)( where you're out there without your crutch and life just takes your breath away. You feel like you're drowning. You sir, are strong enough to overcome these moments.  


Stay on the meds. STAY ON THE MEDS. Call your friends. Make sure to have something for them, maybe a meal, a movie or what, but nurture those relationships. If I oculd get over a few of my issues, you can beat this.
Major kudos on all of those tough changes, sounds like you've really turned a corner. You're demonstrating some incredible strength and you have a great face! Good luck with everything!
You are such a role model man! you're awesome!
Yeah it’s scary but good in the long run. From the sounds of it this is a complete turn around for you so it should feel strange. Proud of you internet friend, you deserve all the happiness that comes to you. Also amazing beard.
Mad jealous of your beard. Keep up the good work, hobbies definitely help, and so do friends. You are what you believe yourself to be, and that can be a spiral if you lose that belief in yourself. Stay positive friend!
Congrats! It’s really hard, speaking from experience, but what you’re doing is worthwhile. Keep going!
Swimming tho.... 

I think sun and excersize can do some great things for your mood. Keep that up.
You look great, and you're already accomplishing big things. Keep your head up and keep on keeping on!
Good for you taking the first steps to regain the control in your life.  Be proud of yourself.
Proud of you! Meds, therapy, exercise, and supportive friends have been a great combination for me as well. You've got this! Also, you have a really kind face.
Keep up the good work!!!
Congrats on being sober! It can definitely be scary to start change but you’re doing great! Also I love your beard 😊😊
You look a lot like this youtuber lordminion777, and that isnt a bad thing lol

Rock on dude, you got this
You are very attractive! that beard is glorious and you have a smile in your eyes. Congrats on feeling again. Depression can be hard, but you're here and you're doing things to make yourself feel better. Keep going!
I know exactly how you feel about the scary and good feeling of depression lifting- I’m in it now. Good for you for talking all those amazing healthy steps!!! You’re so capable to live a happy healthy life and you’re good enough and worthy of it all
wow I am really happy and proud to read you are doing so much to help yourself. very soon  you will see the positive results, I promise.
I have been drug and depression free for about nine years, so I can tell you by experience the hope you feel is real.

have a lovely day.
I’ve struggled with depression my entire life and I think this is a *good* thing. Only people who have experienced the highs and lows of human existence can create something *truly* great.
I'm in the same place my friend. Keep your mind and body busy.
Wow.. thanks everyone! This sub is so nice! Made my day that much better. Nice to feel something positive from social media!
I’m jealous of your beard.
Sweet beard you’ve got there!
Proud of you man!!! I know a lot of folks who aren’t doing half the self care you are while going through these changes. Get ready to meet a new exciting version of you!!
This makes me so happy to hear! Looking good too!
You iz one handsome mothafucca.
My friend, you are so goddamn brave and so goddamn cool. This post makes me insanely happy to see. I find it hard to find the words to convey how beautiful I think this is because I so deeply want it to be heard. Keep doing exactly what you’re doing <3
I wish I could upvote this more than once. I second every single thing said here. Kudos to you OP.
I’m sorry to hear about your mom. I once read that we are never truly adult until our parents pass; but people live on in our memories of them and I believe we honor them through those memories. Nobody ever loves us like a mother can but we love others and are loved in other ways. I hope you find much peace and love in your life.♥️

Oh, and you have excellent glasses 😊
Let me preface this by saying, I posted this earlier on another subreddit and a kind stranger suggested I post here, which after much debate here I am. Unfortunately, it is a mere copy/paste below of the original as that was hard in its own to do. Thank you for listening. 


Umm, this is a hard thing for me, not quite sure how to go about this other than be honest and hope I imagine. I lost my mom due to lupus this year, and being that she was the only parent who played a role in my life, it has been quite devastating to say the least. I got stuck with one of my aunts, and my cousin as the only real family I have at this point, and even to say they least, they have done more harm than good. I could go on and on with this post but why bother, by now you get the point. The most support I have received is from my friends, although as they are male it is so much harder for me to talk and be open to them like I can a girl. And honestly, I would be so very content with listening over talking myself about the above, for the sole fact that a change of pace would be so nice at this point. Dread aside, I like to listen to music or watch a good movie, play videos games, and laugh as a few interests or “distractions.” It isn’t that I don’t have fun, just when I am alone lately, I dunno. I’ve said enough. Even if no one posts a reply, thank you for listening reddit I appreciate it.
It’s been 22 years since my mom died. It gets easier but it never goes away. Regardless of what/who you believe/don’t believe in, your mom will reveal herself to you different, subtle ways. A memory, a smell, a story someone tells you. She’s there. 

Don’t hold yourself up to someone else’s standard of what it means to grieve, don’t repress your feelings either. 

I know for a fact your mom loves you.
Take your time to grieve for your mom. I also lost my dad two months ago and I still cry randomly whenever something happens that reminds me of him. I feel your pain. You may feel alone but I believe they're out there rooting for us. Hang tight fella. I hope someday you'll find your rainbow in your sky.
My cousin lost his dad at 23. I could see it was really hard on him. It can’t be easy on anyone but I know you can get through it.
Keep carrying the good she inculcated in you, remember the best and most important things she passed down, and your life will naturally honour hers
That's really rough. Your kindness and gentle compassion are testaments to the way your dear mother raised you. Remember, she's only a memory away.
Lost my mom at 22, I know how you’re feeling. Stay strong, she loves you and would want to see you blossom! Sending you a big hug!
Your mom loved you, you grew up to be a great person. This is testament to the absolute joy she had raising you. Don't feel too sad, she wouldn't want that.
Lost my mom last august. Im coming up on the first anniversary and I can tell you, you have to take time to be alone and grieve or else you'll destroy yourself. 

There is no other pain in the world quite like it. It gets easier. Keep living, do it for yourself.
I was in the same boat but that was when I was 19. 

Now I’ve lived over half my life without her. 

It’s hard man - but I’ve found i need to work on myself, keep active, and find ways to honor her with my way of being
You were hit with something that will happen to us all, but we hope never will. And you still put effort into dressing well being presentable, which is more than I think I'd be able to say for myself.

I also have to compliment your glasses they fit your face really well, great choice!
I’m so sorry to hear about your loss. Hang in there. Ps your beard is sick
Wow. What a hard time to go through. But the thing is, you will go THROUGH it and come out the other side. You'll never stop grieving. I haven't at least, but life moves forward. You'll never lose her completely. You are a part of her and she is a part of you. 

Never resist the urge to cry or vent or express how you're feeling. Art is good. People are good. You will make it through this hardship. Life will go on. It might feel like time has stopped, but someday it will start again. Sending positivity and respect.
I lost my mother two years ago. I wanted to kill myself. Nothing I can say will make you feel better. You will always think of her and the sadness will hit you like a tidal wave. I'm sorry. <3 Just keep going! You got this!
Thank you everyone for your kind words, this has proven a far more comforting endeavor than I imagined when I did this, so thank you so much. I’m gonna reply to everyone on here, just kinda gotta take it in spurts so I apologize for that. And thank you for listening.
My dad died last year. It sucks. You’ll always think you should have done something different, but as a father, I can promise you that you were perfect in her eyes. 😍
Don't be sad, your mother is still alive in you
Your mom must have been amazing for you to love her so much. If that's true, then she must have passed on all of her positive qualities to you. Her legacy lives through you, and you have the chance to preserve it.
You will get through this.
Don't be afraid to open up to your friends, they won't make you talk unless you want, but I'm sure they will be there for you for anything you want. Even if you don't feel like talking about it, its not good to bottle it up. Talk with them, cry if you need it, there is no shame in that, you even need courage in doing it. I'm really sorry for your lost, and hope you get back in your feet soon
I lost my mom several years ago, even now it sometimes hurts. But it gets easier to do the day to day stuff too. If you need to talk my inbox is always open. 

The thing I found helped me most was turning to my friends. My family, like yours, did more damage than good. But I've built up a family of my own choosing and I wouldn't trade them for the world. 

Take the time to grieve however you need. Remember, you aren't going to grieve the same way as anyone else, and no matter what anyone else tells you, you should only feel what you feel, not what they think you should. It takes a lot of courage to reach out, to friends or internet strangers for help. I hope you find comfort here.
That’s just one of the hardest parts of it all for me to cope with right now, just considering my age, my WHOLE life is such a long fucking time she can’t be a part of and it tears me to pieces.
Thank you however for your honesty, it is appreciated all the same.
Yeah

I get it. I really was just a kid. 

I’m happy to talk more about it - if you’d like to as well send me a PM
I’d like to add that I hope you message me 

And that I might reach out to you first

Edit: did just that - I’d like to support you - for real
Sorry to hear all of that. I hope it all goes well.

We can't see everything from here, but your new hair doesn't look bad to be honest!
That all sounds shitty. I hope your life changes all work out for the best. Depression always sucks and makes everything else worse. But your haircut will grow out and your parrot will bring happiness to others and maybe again to you. Hang in there. You’re young and cute. All things pass ♥️
I'm really sorry that you're going through such a hard time! I hope you won't have to get rid of your friend! (but if you ever need people who aren't gonna judge this community (including me) is always here!) I hope your life's gonna turn for the better! hang in there!
as a side note: the first thing I thought when I saw the picture I though "oh this dude has dope hair!" I actually love the hair and I think the dye job looks good (and the hair colour works great with the colour of your eyebrows 10/10, seriously). I can't see the cut but I'm sure it's not bad! plus you've got a nice face so I'm sure you can pull of even the worst of haircuts!
Stay good my bro and I hope you can find a way to keep your parrot or take it to a good home.
So you're a fighter?  Depression definitely hard-modes things, but you've got this.  Try to ignore the inner jerkass if you can
That's a lot of changes at once, I hope things level out for you soon! Is contacting a pet sitter (or something similar) about a long-term boarding situation an option? Some pet stores and bird breeders will do this too, if you got your pet from one. And your hair looks fine. Good luck with everything!
What’s it cost to keep the pet friend? Not in America or familiar with GoFundMe, but it’s a thing. Is there a way we can make this happen? It hurts my heart.
Parrots can be registered as therapy pets! Please look into this before getting rid of him! If it is registered then you legally are allowed to let it live with you
Knowing he might make someone as happy as he makes me kinda makes it seem better, I’m just going to be so careful who I have to give him to as it breaks my heart to think he’ll keep going from home to home as most large birds do
In honesty a lot more then I would be comfortable receiving, going to have to work a lot of hours to afford to buy a new place as renting is hard with pets. 

Some other factors come in to play meaning it harder to keep him
I’ve been thinking about him. Is there any option that would allow you to give him to someone for a while and take him back later, when your circumstances permit?
He’s at my sisters house atm while I concentrate on work, I might see if she can car for him long term but she already has a parrots 2 dogs and two cats, if she can look after him permanent though I could still see him I guess
Maybe that would work. You could see him and plan to take him back some day. Give it a try? ♥️
bro ur art is SO good and i just get really cool vibes from you wow
You drew those at 18?! That's professional level work right there. I'm a professional artist at a game company and if someone had told me a coworker of mine drew those I would have absolutely believed them. You have a great grasp of 3D space in 2D; your anatomy and shading is fantastic; and overall I just love your style! When I was 18 I couldn't draw like that. Hell, I'm not sure I'm quite that good even now!  
  
There are lots of paths you could take to have a good career in art. Don't let the starving artist stereotype scare you. Game development, for example, would offer 2D concept art, 3D modeling (environments, creatures, characters), animation, or effects. If games don't sound like your thing you could also do graphic design, illustration, 2D or 3D animation for film and tv, comics, more indie type stuff, etc.  
  
I grew up drawing (animals and dragons!) and making little clay animals. Now I 3D model, texture, animate, do effects, and sometimes even rigging (skeletons for the models). It wasn't until I was, coincidentally, 18 that I discovered that game art was an option. I went to college for it but this was before YouTube tutorials were a thing. These days there are several ways to learn what you need to know for whatever art career you choose.  
  
I'd be happy to chat more with you about what path you want to take and how to proceed, critique your art, or if you just want someone to talk to. You're off to a very strong start and I think you've got a great future ahead of you in art! :)
"Walls aren't there to keep us out, walls exist to keep others out who don't want it as badly as we do".

There is a high supply and low demand for artists, but that doesn't mean there is no demand. Work hard, keep at it, make it into a job and you will be able to make a living off of it.
i think your art is gorgeous and you should keep at it. you are also, very beautiful. keep going at your art. if its what you enjoy, don't let anything stop you from continually doing it. <3
Your art is great! Reminds me of a friend who loves to draw. Your art looks like something I would want to see in an artist alley at a convention :)
Dude your art style is amazing! I’m a second year illustration major and I totally love the way you draw people and dragons!!! People love a good dragon drawing it’s hard to pull off and with your art style I totally think you can make money! Never give up on your dream!!
Can we see more of your drawings, they're cool af
I have a friend who works as a 3D artist at a video game company. I think you would do great at something like that. If you're this gifted at 18 you can definitely make it. Just find an education that works for you.
Your art is pretty good. And even if it doesn't take you anywhere, you're still creating something cool and original.
Hey! Fellow artist here! It’s so so so tough to remain positive especially if you’re not getting interaction or business for your art! I just want you to know how amazing you are! I’m so jealous of your talent and creativity! Please keep at it because you seriously so skilled! I hope you have a fantastic week!
Those are some dope dragons. 10/10 would fit perfectly into any illustrations for comics or other kinds of stories with pictures.
I like your art! The lil alien silhouette would make a cool tatt
So jealous of your art! You're amazing!
Okay your art is absolutely amazing!!! 😍
fellow artist here (who really relates to how you feel!), honestly I think your art is really cool! I'd 10000% buy it as a print or sticker if I had the chance! whatever you plan to do with your art, I'm sure you're gonna make it! just hang in there!
also, I really like your colour! did it use to be some shade of pink? either way, adore it!
Your art is so great m. Considering those are just doodles, i can only imagine how amazing a finished artwork by you would be like! Have confidence in your work!
Art doesn’t always translate into a check but it can still take you places in life. It can help you academically. It can be a conversation starter. It can help you network and/or make friends. 

Whether you pursue it as a passion or a profession, art is to be appreciated. First and foremost by yourself. Even on days when the rest of the world passes by, appreciate your own talent and hard work, and remember that no one can take that away from you
I know so many professional visual artists, like 5-10% of them didn't start getting serious about art until after highschool, a few people I know were super serious about art in highschool, then took a huge long break before getting back into it. 
****
Your art looks great, the self doubt is normal af
Hey, great dragons! Seriously. And the demon girl is very well drawn. Your strokes look confident, you obviously know what you're doing, not just doodling randomly like I did when I was your age.
Hey, you're fantastic. You are going places with this. Trust me. I see that you like fantasy artwork. I am a small publisher of RPG books, and I would use your stuff. I know a dozen or more people who would, too. Do you have a deviantart or artstation page?
What?! You drew what’s on your card?! Don’t stop! Don’t give up! Hopefully you will become a great artist, I bet you’d be a great illustrator for books, but even if it isn’t the main driver in your life please don’t give up. You have a talent and you should keep it up.
Your art is amazing! Have you ever considering making a web comic? I think with art like that you could make something wonderful.
Toast: I would be totally cool with your drawing a photo of my family! You're talented enough that I would enjoy seeing your work.

Light toast: I won't pay for it.
That girl is literally the protagonist of an amazing story that just hasn't been written yet. 

You're amazing!
You're absolutely gorgeous, your cosplay is frickin phenomenal, and your art is even more impressive than the latter.
I can just see that you a bursting with creativity and that there is so much you are yet to create. Those drawings are seriously amazing and the quality of them is what I'd expext from drawings in a fantasy story. Keep going and you'll definitely go far.
As someone with no knowledge about how to draw, those look incredible! Awesome! Please do not let the world lose your gift by fear. Keep on keeping on! I wish you all the best! :)
Wow that's so good
Your art is pretty fucking sick dude!! I hope you feel better. I love your hair by the way!!
Holy shit your dragons are amazing. With practice you can definitely find a great illustration or animation career. :)
Well ur frickin gorgeous
Your arts really good! It could lead to fantasy themed commissions in the future, along with other jobs are themed. I wish you luck on the hard times, but don't give up!
If your art is already that good at 18 it's going to take you places, I promise!
You have a really nice style and your grasp of anatomy and shading is really nice
At 18 I wish my art was as good as yours. Just keep practicing and trying to improve!
Yea that kind of art could be used in plenty of places- game design for a new fantasy game. covers for books. The movie industry always needs artists. There are plenty of places art can take you. Just stick with it!
This comment actually made me cry it means so much to hear that. I have been wanting to get into 3D animation for years but my laptop can’t handle simple programs so I have to wait. And currently my art style isn’t consistent enough for animation, I keep changing art style every few frames and it’s kind of annoying. Do you post your art anywhere? I would really like to see some of your work you sound amazing 💛
Thank you so much! Coincidentally I’m applying for a stall at a convention in my city soon, I’m really excited but also worried I won’t get any buyers
Thank you so much. I post on Instagram, my username is Satiriical. I sometimes post on Deviantart, which is also Satiriical.
This comment actually made my day, I really appreciate it. I’m preparing prints to sell at a convention at the end of the year but my self esteem just kinda hit a low and I’ve been telling myself I’m not good enough to sell my art.
Thank you so much! My deviantart is Satiriical, it hasn’t been updated in a bit but I plan on adding more to it. I’ve had that deviantart for nearly five years so you can see me terrible old art on it too
I started a concept for a web comic based off one of my demon characters, Cenetia (the girl in the top corner but drawn more realistically) but I never got around to actually doing it. I might give it another go though
10/10 best toasting
Haha it made me cry that I made you cry! Seriously it means just as much to me that I could help another artist even if it's a small thing.  
  
I don't have a portfolio style place I put my work-related art, [just my cosplay on DA](https://www.deviantart.com/talaayacosplay), but here are a few of my favorite things I've made for the game I work on:  
A scepter that has a stone serpent on it which, when the weapon is drawn, comes to life and flies beside you - [visual link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnRfv3Z3DjM) - [wiki link](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Xiuquatl)  
A floating tome that has a demon imprisoned inside, which creates a shadowy clawed hand around your own - [visual link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD2R5hwVr6Y) - [wiki link](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Binding_of_Ipos)  
An angry little treasure chest mini pet - [link](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mini_Angry_Chest)  
Dragon wings you can wear as a backpack and also glide with - [visual link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upe9FrDJ6kw) - [wiki link](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Scaled_Dragon_Wings_Backpack_Glider_Combo)  
A giant cauldron for Halloween - [link](https://d3b4yo2b5lbfy.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/fa73a10_23-SMK-Screenshot-03.jpg)  
A set of weapons with snakes on them, which internally is called the Danger Noodle set, lol - [link](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Funerary_weapons#Gallery)
You can try low poly 3D animation. It demands less resouses and is very beautiful in its own way. Try Blender, it's free and there's an amazing subreddit where you can learn a lot. Voxels (3D pixels) art is even less demanding to resouses and is super fun to make. Try MagicaVoxel. It's also free and supports animation.
You are SO good enough to sell your art! Hell yes! I know people will love your work! You’ve got such a talent and I can tell buy just the little you’ve shown here! :) I’m so glad I was able to make you feel a little better! If you ever need a friend or to vent or anything im always hanging around :) I’m so excited to hear you’re going to sell your art! I know you’ll do great things :3
What convention?
That stuff is fantastic! I love, love the kirin. Man, I'mma hit you up when I need stuff for my books.
Okay, so your stuff even from when you were 13 is not bad. My favorite pieces of yours are the RICKI series (female Rick from Rick and Morty?), and that Dragon King. Your absolute best is that SamPanther Offspring Custom. That's the kind of thing I really like. You're going to hit the big time one day.
If you do, can you link me its URL? I'd totally follow it, feel free to DM or PM me a link for it, I'd really appreciate it.
This is my little guy Harrison. ~~Turn~~(edit) Draw him into a little monster.

[https://imgur.com/a/iL22Xjt](https://imgur.com/a/iL22Xjt)
Brisbane Supanova, it’s an Australian thing. I’ve been wanting to sell prints for a long time but always doubted I’d do any good
Thanks for checking out my deviantart, I plan on being more active now that I’ve graduated
Thanks so much! Ricki was basically the female rick and Morty character I made while I was still learning how to draw people, and yeah I was really proud of those two pieces as well.
Yeah I’ll definitely send you a link
[https://imgur.com/a/XeuQoKP](https://imgur.com/a/XeuQoKP)

&#x200B;

He was much too cute to draw as a monster so I gave him a monster instead

&#x200B;

Sorry he looks a bit older in the drawing I've never actually drawn a child before but I tried my best

&#x200B;

Also sorry its sketchy its midnight, my art skills aren't the best right now

Ah I've heard of Supanova. That's so awesome! Unfortunately I'm in the US so I'm too far away. I wish I could go. I think you're going to do great! And just remember that if you don't sell well, that doesn't mean you're not a good artist!
Have you thought of using watercolor or digital stuff to create a watercolor effect? That SamPanther one (it's what I call a kirin), has such an organic look, i bet if you did things in that style and with watercolor transparency it would look incredible.
Thank you! I hope you have a great day, and don't worry, if you do amazing web comics, I know you can make a living from it eventually. I hear about a lot of amazing webcomic artists that do, and they'll even go to cons and sell merch and books.
I love it! I'm sending it to my wife right now. That was very quick and you're very talented! Keep up the good work and remember that all of the best artists (music, art, literature, etc) often harnessed their skills through frustration and their desire to overcome instead of give up.

Actually watercolour (along with gouache) is my main traditional media I just don’t post traditional stuff often. Sorry for the late reply
I’m really glad you like it, he’s an absolute cutie and I loved drawing him!
I LOVE YOU
Hey you did a good thing be proud of yourself! I chopped off all my hair once too "because I was getting *too much* unfair *advantage*" 🤦‍♀️absolutely hated it but guess what? It grows back. And meanwhile you get an opportunity to develop some personality because you don't have your pretty hair to hide behind anymore/
this might sound weird but... i wish i had ur face shape
I fuckin love your hair. I wish I had hair like that.
It's looking really good! And it is a great gesture what you did a year ago, you should be proud of that!
Not much of a consolation prize, but I rather like your look right now. Very attractive
That is such an amazing thing for you to do, and I think your hair looks absolutely amazing!
The good you did in getting your head shaved, the comfort you provided a child with cancer or their family by doing so, the solidarity you showed them by doing so, can't be measured or trimmed or restyled or in any way improved upon. Consider this dip in self-confidence as your small sacrifice in the service of those more in need of such a boost than you. Have faith that your confidence will return, because it, like your full and gorgeous hair, will return. The world needs more beautiful people like you.
yall really making me tear up with all of your really kind comments. i really needed this <3
I am so proud of what you did! you did a really amazing deed and should be proud of yourself! I wish I had the courage to do something like that!
that said you look really great! your hair is really cute and your face is really attractive! if I were to see you somewhere I'd 100% comment to a friend how attractive you are!
hang in there! I know how hard and anxiety inducing it can be to wait for your hair to regrow (had some not-so-good haircut experiences) but it will regrow and you will be all happy with it again in no time!
I had to shave my head once due to a hair pulling disorder called trichotillomania. Patience is key! And your hair is very long already- keep it up!
Your hair now looks nice as it is, and I'm sure it'll grow back even better than before eventually. You're very pretty to boot. What you did was a good thing, and that'll shine through in your personality.
Do they have a cunning plan for your hair?
You did something amazing. Something that not many could or would do. 

I hope you realize and appreciate that as much as we do
Kudos on the bravery to donate your hair! I'm sorry you're not happy with it now, although I think it's lovely, you have a beautiful color and it frames your face very nicely!
Your absolutely beautiful on the outside but on the inside...your simply angelic. You have more internal fortitude than I do as a 29 year old man. 
 
When you next look in the mirror and have self doubt, just picture the lucky person who is smiling ear to ear with your gorgeous hair! 

God bless you
You did a really selfless thing! You should be proud of yourself :) and! I think your hair looks so cute at the length you have it at :) really flatters you!
Your hair looks great! You did it for a good cause, too. Stay happy :)
HAHA THANKS <3
thank you so much!! :\]\]
thank you so much :\]\]
bless you! thanks so much for this comment, really helping me out to relearn how to love myself :)
thank you so, so much for your comment. this truly means so much. god bless you. :) <3
thank u so so much <3
thank you **SO** much. i really appreciate it <3
thank you, i really appreciate your comment. <3
gosh, i dont know what to say. thank you so much for your comment, i truly appreciate it. being viewed as angelic.. wow that is a sure confidence booster. thank you so so so much!!!! <3
<3
You majestic eagle of a man. Spread your wings and  I'm sure you'll find happiness.
Don’t apologize. You’re beautiful just as you are, and just as deserving of love as your friends. And don’t worry about rushing to get into a relationship, you’ll find someone perfect of you and completely loving.
Brother, I know everyone keeps saying it and it feels like bs, but the most important thing is attitude. 
 ****
Find a human that is excited to spend time with you and makes you feel the same, make "this awesome person thinks I'm awesome" your standard.
  ****
I'm hairier, fatter, and more ginger than you, and once I realized 'a relationship' is not a goal and set out to meet awesome beautiful people my life changed like in days (extreme results I know, a housemate at the time commented on the suddenness of the change)
Don't worry about being fat. My husband is fat and has always been. I love him to death. Just focus on other good things, like sense of humour, some hobby, etc. and you will eventually meet someone who will love you just as you are.
Your skin looks great
there is nothing you should apologise for! you look and are great just the way you are!
I completely understand how you feel but don't worry about it too much! give it enough time you will find the one! 
hang in there and take care!
It's just around every other corner, but timing can be a bitch! One of those days you'll turn the right corner at the right time, don't you worry!
It might be a cliche but you need to love yourself before anyone else can love you. Don’t be so hard on yourself and you have nothing to apologize for
If you’re sorry, do something about it then.

Otherwise don’t apologize.
Dude, everyone is awesome! Just in a different way. It’s about finding out what makes you awesome and unique. And then living it with all your heart. Don’t try to fit in. Try to make a difference. And do what YOU think and feel is right, not what others tell you. And by living it you will find your confidence. And there is nothing more sexy than confidence. Looks fade, character stays. And a great character makes everyone shine. You know those supermodel types that are arrogant and ignorant as f**k? From far away you think they are great. But when you get to know them, their beauty fades. Why? No character. So, work on the character and everyone will want to be like you and with you. I’m sure you will make your way!
The thing is, I have no real social cues or anything, I was pretty much the outsider my whole life and it doesn't help I was abused as a child so there's that too.
We have lived a similar life, in some ways.  I had to actively learn to read people's body language.  Working door helped a lot

****
Edit: Abuse is hard, trust is always a risk, but if someone acts unreasonable, then thank them for the warning sign
Would unreasonable be like dumping a person after 3 months and claiming no chemistry?
People leave, it feels awful, and it's almost, alas, always a good thing in the end.
****
Brother, it's rough, but try not to use it as an excuse to be down on yourself.  It's ok for shit to fail, doesn't make you a failure.
Yeah I know but that was thr first girl to talk to me in 3 years. I know it's hard to change and I work 2 jobs. I huat have no confidence thanks to the abuse.
First, not last
****
 Try not to dwell
Ur pretty hot tbh
Good looking and smart.  Your better than living in a state like Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, Florida, or Texas.  Could also toss in Tennessee or Kentucky.
Job hunting can be so hard, especially when your chosen field isn’t common in your area. You might consider moving out of your state if there just aren’t the opportunities there to launch your career. If it helps you, remember that job hunting is a lot like love - you might strike out 100 times in a row, but you’re really only looking for 1 solid win and all the other rejections are irrelevant. If you feel like you’re getting turned away a lot right not just know that your win is still on the way. Be kind to yourself until that then.
1: Damn, that is some really nice hair. I am jealous!

2: You do realize you can move to another state, right? It's growing "as fast as average (8%) - [https://www.bls.gov/oes/2017/may/oes191029.htm](https://www.bls.gov/oes/2017/may/oes191029.htm)

3: California, Oregon, and Washington states have a very high demand for Biologists.
Yo good luck getting a job. You can do it
Your hair is pretty great, man. Not gonna lie. I have long hair myself but it's definitely not as cool as yours.

But hey, while I can't help with our whole shitty outlook on science I can tell you that I do value science and scientists. Most people might not understand how valuable what you do is but a lot of us do and we're appalled at what's happening lately.

Anyway, I hope things work out for you. Keep fighting the good fight, brother.
Just because some troglodytes don't see vaule in what you do doesn't mean it's not important. You ARE a crucial part of our society. Keep you chin up! There are many people, myself included, that value people like you! And if all else fails you could try modeling. You are absolutely stunning to look at! 

You have got this! Don't lose hope! I believe in you!
By being in the bioscience field you've already proved that you can learn ANYthing. You're valuable! Keep your head up.
What a badass career. Sounds really interesting and like you get to do meaningful work. Science is important now more than ever... we need more people like you!
Don’t limit your thinking to one country ...maybe time to go international
Pic a passion that you want to pursue as a biologist and just do all that you can because you care! That's all that matters in the end and I bet you will be phenomenal!
at the risk of sounding shallow, you're really damn hot! I love the hair so much! looks like you take good care of it - for which props to you!
I am so sorry that job hunting is hard and I really hope you're gonna find a good job soon! you seem really smart so I'm sure you will manage!
take care! good luck!
Move to another state?
Sorry you’re feeling this way. You’re doing amazing work and I hope that you’ll find a place to live one day that recognizes that. Good luck!
You are beautiful and intelligent. I know there's a lot of other states that would treasure someone of your skills and abilities working there.
The world needs more scientists. Don’t lose hope or give up, we are counting on you.
Well done on being better informed than your own government, hopefully you can escape to somewhere better soon!
love your hair! you clearly take good care of it
I appreciate all the words of encouragement! I do try to stay positive but sometimes it can be a little overwhelming.
Honestly I stopped scrolling because you’re hot. Literally you’re doing the most valued work in the world, FUCK whoever is holding you back.
My degree/career path choices are also not valued, you’re not alone. Keep your chin up, lady. Something will come along and you’re going to rock it so hard. ❤️❤️❤️
Yeah, I unfortunately live in one of those. Not for long, hopefully.
I'm just going to mention this because a lot of people have no idea. A big part of why this guy is having trouble is that under Trump scientific endeavors have fallen off the list of priorities for the government. That's just objectively true. It's not my opinion. He's going to have trouble in any state, probably. I know most people aren't aware of this but look at what's going on with the USDA for example. That's probably the most visible example. This is something everyone should at least know about. Maybe you care and maybe you don't, I don't know, but you really should at least know about it.
Yeah, my plan is to move but the trouble is saving up enough. I have been applying for other states very often though. I didn’t know about those states having a high demand though!
I want to study mycology and get my PhD in it, and that’s the goal that drives me forward. It’s hard to know how to take the first steps though.
This is sadly true.  But I live in a state that already underfunds sciences so it’s even worse.
If you haven't already, the link provided is a good place to start when it comes to viewing the supply and demand of different states
Find someone who studies in mycology and go and ask them some questions!
My Dad is bipolar - has been really healthy for 20 + years. He is a nurse and one of the best I've ever witnessed. He is a kind soul who works his butt off. I'm sure you can do it, it won't be easy, but keep studying, keep working hard, & most importantly don't forget to take care of yourself!
My friend... I see you think your bipolarity is progressing and you feel worse...

You're brave for posting, for seeking help. I think you're beautiful also. And you're definitely smart... You got wit and see things under a light other's don't or can't.

Things will get better. Persevere. Trust yourself and love yourself.

I remember when I cried on my first English class... I got around my fear by reading English jokes! Try to remember what you love about nursing... That will help you keep going.

You can also pm me if you want to keep talking, I know how lonely the world can get sometimes.
Bipolar will not hold you back. You've already committed to something challenging - and presumably that you have a passion for - and come what may, you will rock it.   
Plus, you got style, and an awesome jacket. Winning.
On my first day of nursing school (this past May) I sat in the parking lot before class and cried. Once I got out of class I called my mom and told her I couldn’t do this. 3 months later I’m about to end my first semester and I am so proud of my accomplishments. 

You can do this. It will be tough, but it is doable. Good luck and pm me if you need advice/want to talk about nursing school.
Someone very dear to me is bipolar. Things were very hairy for a while, but this person is now very successful and happy. Don't. Stop. Fighting.

Be open with your loved ones about your struggles, and keep working on finding the treatment  thats going to allow you to live a close to normal life. There is a bearable life out there for those of us with mental health concerns. We just have to lean on each other and get each other through the tough stuff. We KNOW you can do it! Maybe you can't RIGHT NOW, and if that's really the case, that's ok. Your health comes first, friend!

Every job I've taken since college has intimidated me. I struggle with anxiety, depression, and recently diagnosed panic disorder. Together, these ailments give me the feeling that I just can't perform as well as other candidates. Sometimes that's true, but most times it's not. Bipolar is a lot more challenging than what I've got though, and I am so proud of you for trying! 

I don't know how old you are, but at 28, I've had to train myself not to measure my success by the yardstick of other people. Most people your age don't have that extra weight to overcome. Waking up is easy, they sleep and eat normally, and they don't literally get sick with worry over anything. Factor in the extra weight you're pulling and forgive yourself for having to ease up sometimes. 

You're absolutely adorable, by the way, and I hope that something comes your way this week that will make you smile. We all deserve happiness, and you're no exception. Whatever path you take regarding your education, just know that you can find the seeds of success along both. And we're here if you need someone to walk along with you awhile.
It will take more work but you can do anything you put mind too. You are a beautiful young women. The hill is just bigger for some than others.
Grad school pushed me to my limit in so many ways, my anxiety being one of them. You are already making a huge step going to class this afternoon. You will make an amazing nurse, as overwhelmed as you are don’t lose sight of that, you’ve got this!!
Hey you didn’t give up and went back for your other classes. If you decide to take a different path there is no shame in that either. You are also very pretty and I love your bangs though I might be a bit biased because mine are the same. 🙂
As hard as the realization hits you, it's never a failure when you discover what you hoped to do is not your cup of tea. I started off in journalism in University and hated every minute of it. By second year first semester, I couldn't handle it anymore and I went into a semester of limbo after. During that time, I found my passion for history, and now have my Bachelor of Arts in the subject. However, this is just me. 

It's possible you'll get through this semester and realize this isn't what you want to do, but you'll find something you're passionate about. I can't imagine how difficult things are with bipolar, but I have PTSD. I'll admit, it was hard to keep up with studies at times, but there are people on campus who genuinely care, and can help you through. First weeks are always extremely overwhelming, it will take time to adjust. Keep us updated with how things are going. If you need any encouragement, feel free to DM me.

Hello! Fellow bippie here (it's a word I made up, it's fine.)

Normal life and workload is an overwhelming task for us, and our stupid brains will make it worse with taunts and jeers.

Ignore it.

There is one mantra that I've kept in mind whenever I'm having a rough patch

"I am in control."

Our disorders don't define us, they're just a part of us. Tell it who is in charge

Make schedules and keep them. Meditate, be mindful, enjoy your time and your experiences.

You are in control.
u can do it girl. it will be hard but in the end ur gonna be successful and you’ll be proud of how hard u worked. also i like ur septum and freckles hehe
You can. Don’t let it hold you back. Take it one class at a time, one day at a time, one clinical at a time, don’t let it overwhelm you. You’ve got this.
Congratulations on being accepted to Nursing school and choosing a profession of service! 
You have come this far and while nursing school will be hectic, just remember why you chose the profession, take care of yourself and all the rest will work itself out. I’m rooting for you.
I’m bipolar too and from one BP to another, today as you know, can be a completely awesome day.   For people like us there’s no middle ground, I know.   But give it another day.   And another.  Get a week in and reassess.   Try two weeks and compare the two.    You’ve got the brains to be in this program, and you’re quite pretty as well, so this just might be a great thing if you see it through.  One day and one week at a time.   You got this.    ;
Oh girl you’re amazing and you have got this!! I know how much bipolar can hold you back but just take every day as it comes and if need be, go back (or go if you haven’t already) to the doctors and tell them you’re struggling. Don’t let it take over!! I know that’s easier said than done, especially coming from someone who’s having an up day rather than down.

You’re a beautiful, strong woman and your mental health will help you be more relatable once in the nursing profession. Just keep on fighting back.
I went through law school with epilepsy, hardest thing I've ever done. I'd wake up some mornings on the floor 30 minutes before class and had to drag myself to the room to get ready only to arrive late. I never "beat" the epilepsy, but I did learn to over-work it. Try and not think about this in a negative way but rather as a chance to prove to yourself how much you're capable of. You worked hard to get in and you know you're capable of learning it so the only thing that stands in your way is being bipolar. Maybe this is your first real chance to truly overcome!
My sister is a nurse and has bipolar disorder. She completed her nurse's degree and worked as an RN for years. Now she works with plastic surgery patients recovering from other surgeries in an office she loves. She is married, has two kids and two dogs. (OK, the dogs are a little unruly... but I don't think her bipolar is making her give in to the puppy dog eyes every time, lol)

It wasn't easy getting there, but she did it. I wish I could relay to you all of her strategies, but she's pretty sensitive about talking about her diagnosis still and I'm not sure if I could get that out of her in a reasonable time frame... however: Have you looked into whether your school offers any disability programs for mental health diagnoses? Speaking from personal experience, such programs can be extremely helpful to college students: some let you take your tests at different times or by yourself; you can have due dates for projects/homework shifted in response to incidents related to your mental health; and in general, people there are usually able to point you in the direction of more help.

I do know my sister relied heavily on her classmates; I lived with her while she was studying, and I'm pretty sure she went to every group study meet they had. She also stayed on medication prescribed by her psychiatrist all throughout school to help her cope.

Wherever your choices in life lead you, though, I hope you find joy and contentment. Just don't give up before you've given yourself a chance.
Your nose ring is so cute! Its always honna be a hard first day, but imagine if you can get through it like this, with your mental state on hard mode with minimal skill, imagine how good its gonna feel when you're killin it later on! Love the bangs btw!
Dude, I want you to keep going! You're gonna do such great work in this world! Make this into a story about how you overcame adversity and your hard work and dedication paid off!

Also, love your hair!
You're gorgeous.

With that out of the way, I wish you all the luck.  Life is a long journey, take your time and enjoy it. If there's a way to take less classes or shorten your nursing school workload so you can still do it give it a shot. 

Take care Reddit stranger
You got this girl.
I’m bipolar and recently started college. It’s a shock but we’ll do fine. ❤️
You have a sweet kind face that would make a great nurse! 

I have PTSD, depression and anxiety. 
One of the best nurses I know -is my mum! She has bipolar and she’s always done so well in her career 

Wishing you the best x x
Your mental illness is doing the only thing bullies know how to do: make you feel small. This one lives in your brain, so it knows how to hit you where it hurts. Don’t let it win. You were smart enough to get yourself here, and you’re smart enough to graduate and become a kickass, genius, healer of humans. Imagine the young people you will inspire when you beat your brain bully’s  ass and triumph despite its best efforts. Imagine how accomplished you’ll feel. Imagine all the people you’ll help- probably some with the same mental illness you have. You. Can. Do. This. The world needs you.
You got it! The first few weeks are always the hardest. If you can get through the first 100 days you will be fine and will finish! (That’s an actual thing we use in higher ed, if we can support students for their first 100 days and they are doing good they will graduate). Also if you are diagnosed with bipolar please go to your schools disability services and let them help you get accommodations. They can do things like give you more time for assignments/tests, quiet testing, and more. You got this! Also college professors are so much more understanding than you think. Just make sure you communicate with them, you don’t have to tell them everything that’s going on but if they are aware something is going on they will work with you. 

Also create a google calendar with all of your assignments, classes, and tests. It will help you remember what you need to complete and help make it more manageable.

Good luck! You are going to do great!
You look EXACTLY like an amazing nurse I know, except she has silver hair. Maybe, just maybe she was a time traveler from the future that got so good at nursing she came back in time to use her skills where it was most needed
I’m in your shoes girl. Nursing school with mental illness is so hard, but damn is it rewarding. Give it some time, maybe even go to student disability to see if they can do anything to help with your condition. Please let me know if you ever need to talk! I’m almost a senior in nursing school and it’s scary but I’m so glad I stuck with it.
Hi friend ❤️ I’m not in nursing nor do I have bipolar, but I have pretty severe OCD and anxiety and am studying pre-medicine. I remember my first week of classes I had a complete breakdown, because this shit is FUCKING HARD. It’s something that many people go through and persevere through, and there is also zero shame in changing your path if that is what will be best for you. No education is wasted if it brings you to your eventual life  :) I have had luck facing it with humor and professional help! 

I wish you all the best in pursuing your dreams and reaching those goals no matter what they are and become! 

You have such a strong gaze and your strength is shining through your picture. Feel free to pm me if needed!
I thought this was “RoastMe” and thought everyone was being really supportive and kind to what will be the next generation of healthcare professionals.

You’ve got this! Don’t you let anything hold you back!
Hey. The perception of the workload is just a thing...don't panic, try and be calm and assess the situation calmly and day to day.
I cried most days during my first week in nursing school because it was so much work (and I’m a guy!). However, I finished nursing school this December and I’m so glad I stuck it out. I encourage you to do the same, not because I finished it, but because I believe that you can do it!
I know I’m late to the encouragement party, but I brought gifts!! (It’s just a little wisdom, don’t get too excited, lol) 

I’m sorry you felt overwhelmed (possibly still do) but the most important thing to remember there is there is a huge difference between feeling overwhelmed and being incapable. I have the very fun cycle of triggering anxiety, bipolar, and cPTSD, and I’m in my last year of my pre-med program. 

The amount of times I have cried, thought of giving up, been soo anxious that I literally just sat in my driveway with my car in neutral unable putting it in any gear are obscene in retrospect. I still have about a severe enough episode to keep me from getting to class once every 3-4 months, and when they come about, I email my professors and just stop to take the time I need (usually a week). The reason I mentioned that there is a difference between ability and a sense of being overwhelmed, is that is what kept me going back. Even when the week wasn’t long enough to completely recover, it was always enough to build up enough resolve to remind me that the backlog would be worse if it built up beyond that, and I’m more than capable of catching up on a weeks worth of work (communicating with your professor/instructor is critical, most will respond and are willing to work with you even if you tell them you won’t be in touch until you see them in lecture/lab when you come back). 

Someone mentioned going to disability services, that probably the best move you can make. Having an AOD (Accommodation Of Disability) on record makes sure that when you’re struggling, you basically have a promise from the school that they’re not going to penalise you for it, and will instead accommodate you. Take it easy on yourself, do the best you can and you can do it. 

You’re capable, just overwhelmed, making that distinction will help a lot (I hope 😊). You’re awesome for pursuing a goal of any kind given how crippling bipolar disorder can be, be proud of that, and trust in whatever gave you the strength to even attempt to rise above it. 

Also, I’m older than everyone else in my program by about a decade, and the workload is certainly heavier than I expected, but I’m kicking ass and you can too!! If an antisocial, emotionally stunted and struggling old fogey like me can do it, a badass like you can too. Chin up, and feel free to pm me if you need someone to listen, or advise.
My mom always told me this:

“Look, if all of those other kids can do this class, so can you. You are just as smart as the rest of them, so go be where you belong.”

Idk why but It always helped

Good luck! Youre gonna be a great nurse! Stick with it Kiddo! :-)
It will work out at the end ! Trust me you will be able to do it if you stick with it. I’m a guy that’s barley cried but starting uni and taking classes for econ got me crying in the bathroom . But not I’ve passed some of the hardest ones. These are all tests that challenge your willpower and knowledge , they break you and many people don’t get it . I believe in you :)
You’re stronger than you give yourself credit for, don’t give up! You’ll find your flow in time.
I’m in nursing school (only you don’t call it nursing school in Australia) and I have anxiety and depression and a fun little inclination toward substance abuse. The fact that you’ve chosen to study nursing shows that you’re someone who cares deeply about helping others and having a meaningful life (as well as having serious job security, at least here), and that shit is important! Best of luck, you can do this ❤️
You look like the girl from Bonding (Netflix) and she's a badass.
First days always the hardest, and I can tell you’ve got what it takes just from the fact you’re going back ❤️ 

You’re also a stupid amount of pretty so if you ever get sick of nursing, you’ve got modelling to fall back on 😉
You are putting yourself out there and I'm really proud of you for that. If I can be honest, life is not gonna be easy. It will be hard. But if you push through , the rewards will be amazing! Trust me :)
It seems really hard in the beginning, I felt the same with university, but they have supports in place to help, try taking a look to see what your school has for disability support. They can be the nicest people and will be your best friends.

You’ve survived your life in until now and let me say you look awesome, you’ll survive this. My nana always used to say and now my mom does too: “this too shall pass” meaning that some day soon this anxiety about handling the work load and even the work kid will pass you’ll have done it, it can just be hard to get there, but you will! You’ve got this!
You can do this!!!  Don't give up before you've even started!

Even if you struggle, you are still doing the damn thing! 

Be open with your friends, and even be open with your professors if you feel like you are struggling! Most professors want to see the best out of each student, even if it means making accommodations! Your bipolarity will only help you in the healthcare field, you'll be able to connect easier and have more understanding of your patients!

&#x200B;

(PS, your makeup looks awesome!)
It's normal to feel overwhelmed beginning a new course!!! I'm obviously less aware of your abilities than you are, but I don't think many people go into nursing and feel like it's going to be easy. I'd bet 3/4 of your class feels overwhelmed right now.


It is very likely you CAN do this, but if you know for certain you can't do it, that's also ok! A lot of people could not be nurses, it's a really hard job, there is no shame in changing what you're doing if you have to.


Good on you for wanting to help others as your vocation.  If you can't do it, the next step is finding something similarly satisfying for your kind heart (working with children, seniors, plants, people with addictions etc.)


Often people with their own problems are the kindest helpers, it's a superpower you can get from suffering if you work it right. All the best to you, whichever you choose.
You know that chick from NCIS? The quirky lab girl with the outlandish hair? The fan favorite?  


You look like her, but more responsible.
You're beautiful and you're educating yourself to be able to help others and be a productive member of society. You're a great person. You're strong and you can do this!
Your eyeliner is on point 👌 Although I can’t completely relate to your situation, every time I start a new semester the work seems overwhelming and I freak out a little. But I just try to take it one step, one assignment, at a time and by the end I’m amazed at the work I did! Hang in there, you’ve got it.
I’m so sorry you had a hard day. I remember how overwhelming the first day of classes can be, especially when you are struggling with mental illness. 

I want to tell you that you have come this far and you are so strong for going to that second class. I’m so proud of you and you are resilient and capable. You also showed that you are committed to success because you reached out for encouragement. 

I’m proud of you and I wish you all the best. You can do this! You are amazing!
The little heart you drew at the bottom speaks a lot about you. I hope you get better my friend. Trust me, you got this. Good luck.
You have a very sweet face and you remind me so much of the nurse who did my 18m daughter’s intake a few months ago. I was having a meltdown and so was the baby, and she was cool, calm, collected, and most importantly soothing. My kiddo is a spitfire and this woman handled her so gracefully while I held her and cried. I couldn’t even describe the doctor to you, but I still remember the three nurses names (we were in the ER for a really long time). The nurses are the backbone and I’m so thankful. 

Your bipolar doesn’t define you - and you can change lives for the better!
Your really pretty and cute and I love your piercings, your doing great and I believe that you can keep going but remember it's ok if you can't
I’m going to nursing school soon and i have anxiety. We will do it and we will do it well! You absolutely will succeed! ❤️
Sounds like you have great empathy, nurses need that and we need you!!you got this!!!
Don't ever not keep in mind the completely bad ass you that is at the other side of this challenge.  She's waiting for you.  Stay strong.  You can do this.
Feel empowered to reach out when you need to
Hey, I know it’s a lot. Especially Chem, Micro and the anatomy classes. It’s so much memorization and it seems so scary. I’m taking nursing too, and dealing with some health stuff. I don’t have your exact situation but I know what you mean when you say how daunting the load seems when you have a condition like bipolar. Personally, I’m taking one class in the summer and only three per semester. Not a full work load at all. It’s much easier to handle. It’ll take longer to complete the degree but it’s safer for my body and easier on my mental health. Is there a way you can decrease your courseload to be less than full-time? Or are you required to be full-time for the degree? I’ve also found that for classes where I have to memorize a ton of things, making flashcards helps me remember the material. Good luck, sugar. You can do this.
Growth is painful. You've never been this version of yourself. So give yourself some grace, and breathe through it. You will find your balance : ) I'm rooting for you girl!
I know it feels stressful but stick with it for a couple weeks. I am a nursing student as well and was a CNA for years on an Alzheimer’s unit. My first two weeks on that unit were absolutely the most stressful, scary weeks of my life. I cried and said “i don’t think i can do this job” after i got used to the routine of things it became the best job I’ve ever had! Take care of yourself and lay out a plan..once you’re in a comfortable routine you can thrive! If not, that’s ok too. There are millions of paths to take! 

Also, i adore your look. Very gorgeous
I have schizophrenia and like four other mental disorders, including depression. Your not alone. :)
No matter how rough things get, don’t ever quit!  Seek the help and resources to get you through, but realize that the time will pass anyway whether you’re in nursing school or not.  Hang in—- you can do anything for a couple years (and NOBODY likes nursing school, I know).  The payout— massive job availability and good pay has allowed me to fully indulge my hobbies and have enough money to do some traveling.  Keep those beautiful eyes on the prize!  You got this!
It can seem overwhelming but you got this. Just take it one day at a time. Build your support system. Friends, family, meds, therapy, and hobbies will help get you through this. Also, feel free to stop by r/bipolar if you haven't already. It's a really great sub and everyone is incredibly supportive and nonjudgemental. Sending positive vibes your way!
You are so beautiful, and I’m sure you have already proven to yourself you are strong, and can do scary things. I know our brains can try and tell us lies and it’s really hard to step over them, but remember all the times you have succeeded, and proven your bipolar brain wrong, write them down and keep them with you. Although I believe in you, It is also okay if you realize you don’t want to be a nurse, and it’s okay if you keep going to school and in a year realize you don’t want to be a nurse. The universe wants you to be where you are please try not to stress about the future, I know it is easier said than done.
Nursing is a very selfless and kind career to pursue, so first off MASSIVE RESPECT to people like you, future nurses, past nurses, present nurses etc. You will do a lot of good things and help a lot of people! And knowing that you could do that on top of handling your bipolar would make you indestructible. You got this, friend. Good luck! (You're doing great!!!!)
Hugs.
As someone who had diagnosed PTSD after an accident, and depression and am now medicine free preschool teacher.

Don't let it dictate your life. You are not defined by a disease, you are defined by yourself and your actions. Do what you can to make the best you OP.

Don't let it pull you down, adapt and overcome, you can figure out how to live and do your nursing, if nursing is what you love, you'll find a way to overcome any obstacles.
Hey, I'm so sorry your first day got off to this kind of start. I also dealt with mental illness while getting through school (different field but also a crazy workload). It's not easy but it's doable, particularly if you can communicate with your teachers and/or advisor when you're struggling. They want you to succeed, and if they can they'll often be willing to work with you to make that happen. I went to my teachers on more than one occasion when I needed additional time or alternative assignment options and they were great about it. I'd also recommend being in good contact with your doc and/or therapist and keeping that as a priority. You are brave and strong for entering a nursing program, and for putting yourself out there in this post. You can do this if it's what you want.
I moved to get my PhD and cried my very first class. I thought, "I moved my family to get a PhD and I think I made a mistake." Turns out, it wasn't a mistake but those experiences are hard. 

Also, as a person who is a faculty member who also works with other faculty, nursing faculty are among the most heartfelt, genuine people on this earth. Reach out. Tell them how you are feeling. They will work with you. Maybe you don't take as many courses, but don't drop out if this is your goal. They will help you figure things out. They are very understanding and have the biggest hearts of any faculty out there.
Your make-up is beautiful! You look like you could be some kind of forest elf.
Be proud of yourself and the effort you make. Every time you put your shoes on and go to that class, you're making progress. Keep in mind, even baby steps are progress.
Hang in there and I think everything will work out. Please remember that, even in the worst case scenario if you are not able to finish nursing school, you will still have attained many other unforeseen accomplishments as long as you try your best. Wish you the best!
I hope you will be okay! Have a similar problem so maybe its nice to know you are not alone on this. I think eventually it will be clear what you will be doing if you do what feels right for you. All the best
You can totally do it!!! You got this shit yo. 
On an unrelated note... you are VERY attractive.. so you got that going for you, which is nice.
As a fellow bipolar, I understand the feeling that our illness can hold us back. Sometimes it will and sometimes it won't. Either way, in this situation, I'm proud of you for trying and encourage you to keep going. I'm currently doing that with a job I strongly dislike.

And if you find nursing isn't for you (whether because of the illness or any other reason), it's not the end of the world (even if it feels like if is). We keep getting up and kick ass as best we can! A fulfilling life *is* out there for you!

Also, you have really nice skin and I'm a bit jealous! Haha.
You got this. It’s just the first day I’m sure it feels overwhelming, but I bet everyone else feels just like you do.  Just fake it till you make it. Tell yourself you will show up and listen and take notes.  Just keep doing that.  Next thing you know you will have adjusted and you’ll see you can handle this.  

If you got into nursing school despite your bipolar, you can certainly handle sitting in a class and learning.  Have faith in yourself!
Trust me beauty, you can do this. I know things can feel impossible when you’re at the bottom of the mountain. All you need to do is take one tiny step per day. That’s it. At the end of a week, you’ll be up a foot. At the end of the month, you’ll have climbed higher than you are tall. Imagine where you’ll be in a year! 

We are in desperate need of nurses who truly, deeply understand the mental health challenges that many people face. You will make an enormous difference in the life of your patients and your families. You wouldn’t give up on them, so don’t give up on yourself. 

I’m proud of you for reaching out to get a boost. Remember that you don’t have to do this or anything else in your life alone.
Good luck! You can do it. It always helps me to remember that motivation is fleeting and generally only comes after discipline has been there for a while. Then after that I break things into manageable sized chunks and I take lots of mini breaks and just get to work. Things will be great!
I have BPD & schizotypal personality disorder & I’m in my third year of court reporting school, which has a dropout rate of 90%. You. Can. Do. This. These things may always be harder for those of us with mental disorders, but it doesn’t mean we are any less capable. I have all the faith in the world that you can not just get through nursing school, but you will also kick ass in it!!

Edit: You are freaking gorgeous & I’m jealous of your face!
The best is yet to come.
You can do it. You're not the only one who has ever dealt with it and made it to the otherside and you won't be the last. Just take some deep breaths, the road is long but you'll get there. Now chin up, go be that badass you know you are and crush these classes!
You got this! Don’t let anything hold you back!
Give it your best and live in the moment.
Don’t let bipolar hold you back. You’re capable of more than you think. It may be a difficult journey but in the end you’ll be proud of yourself and what you’ve accomplished.
Bipolar is tough. Make sure you are taking care of yourself. Get enough sleep, take your meds if you have them, eat enough. You got this. In a couple years you will be posting on here about how much of an impact you made that day and how much you love your job. I know you will get there.
One day at a time.  Do everything you can every day and see what shakes out.  Don't stress about doing more than what's possible.

Also, go kick ass and figure it out.
Keep moving forward my friend!
Sending prayers
The first day is probably scary for everyone! I believe you will be an excellent nurse because your bipolar is also as of yet unrecognized super power!  You will learn how to use it!
You can do it! A lot of us nurses have mental health issues. It's ok. Push through. I believe in you.
You can do it! 1 step at a time
You can do it!!
I just finished my first of 3 years of nursing school. If being a nurse is something you're really passionate about, and you study hard, no mental disorder can get in your way. YOU CAN DO THIS! GO GET 'EM!
You got this!
I really dig your hair, and I'm kinda jealous of the septum ring because I couldn't possibly pull one off with my garbage deviated septum. I hope you get to feeling better, and can get things figured out.
Former nursing student here- after about two semesters I realized I couldn't handle the workload due to my chronic migraines and severe anxiety and depression. I switched my major to Biology and got into Parks and Recreation (the career path and the tv show) and now I'm the park director for a small government agency. The pay is good, the benefits are outstanding, and I work 8 to 4 every day. Things always work out the way they are supposed to! Message me if you want to chat about it!
Ok...first off, you are stronger than you think. Right now you are thinking too far ahead and getting overwhelmed. Stop doing that. Do one thing at a time and focus on just that thing. The first day of nursing school is horrible. I got so overwhelmed I almost quit. But my therapist told me to only focus on the next thing that needed doing and nothing else. I got through four years of school successfully and you can too!!! You got this! Go kick some ass now!
You got this far!! You can absolutely do it!! Intimidating? Hell yes!  But impossible? No way and your going to change so many peoples live that are in your exact position later! Congratulations!!!
Nursing school! That is a wonderful thing to do and honestly to give up your time and decide that you want to spend your life helping others at their worst makes you one of the best people alive. Well done to you! 

And then your determination in the face of opposition, to make sure that you can go on and help people makes you one of the kindest and most awe-inspiring people around! Go you!
My first thought was about how well the makeup on your eyes (mascara?) is done! I love the wings! Despite being a girl, I have literally no idea how to use makeup (my makeup phase lasted like a week when I was 8, so I didn't learn much) and it really impresses me when I see nice-looking makeup. Wings are my fave! Good job.
You’ve got this - you eat an elephant one bite at a time, right? You might need a few more bites to eat your elephant, but you can still do it. Give yourself credit for getting to where you are, and take it one step at a time.

You’ve got this!
Wow. Hi there, lovely! Fellow Bipolar gal, fellow Nursing student :) 

I think many of the most compassionate people are driven to pursue nursing as a profession. Sure, the workload is intense, and yes, it will be hard. Some days you will wanna scream and pull your hair out. But some days make it all worth it, and those moments are what remind you why you took this path in the first place. Now I definitely won't tell you what to do, as you know best and should trust your gut instinct; but for now I'd encourage you to keep at it. The first year is the most difficult (I'm in my second currently, trust me it improves!)

Wishing you the best of luck in any endeavor you decide. Don't forget to put yourself and your mental health first. Love to you!
Don't give up yet, maybe lighten the work load? What's the rush? You can work at your pace, it's not a race. You'll get there when you're ready. PS. I love your look, you're adorable.
It's awesome that you know your limits. :) Make sure that it actually is a limit and not just anxiety but if that's the case then work with that. You know what you can and cant do so act accordingly. There is NO shame in taking fewer classes if they are over whealming for you. I'm fortunate are enough to not have to deal with anything more than some pretty generic social anxiety and there are semesters where I end up taking just one or two serious classes and then focus on basic GE or PE to get myself up to the unit count I need. It is far better to take fewer classes and need an additional semester even if that means needing to find more financial aid than to take too many, try and force it, fail, and then not be eligible for financial aid. 

You know your limits and that is a BIG deal and impressive. Trust yourself. :) If you're going into nursing you're a smart cookie and deserve to be trusted even if  it's (and possibly especially) by yourself. 

Also, you said that it's your first day of nursing school (and congradulations for getting into that! That's no mean feat in and of itself and deserves some recognition!). Be aware things that sound and start scary often get easier. I'm in engineering and am HORRIBLE at math. I literally started college in remedial where I had to relearn PEMDAS and was dreading calculus and honestly it was as bad as I feared. But here I am still kicking away and I'm about a year out of graduating. I've taken a lot of hits in my classes but have managed to tough it out and I'm confident that if you trust yourself and dont try and force yourself to work by someone else's schedule that you'll make it and do fine.

You got this!
Maybe a different toast approach (approast?) but you look like you have really good music taste and like we could talk for a long time about it. Good luck with school I hope you do well <3
My therapist is bipolar and she's fantastic because she *actually* gets it. Whatever you do, you'll be better able to understand people's needs because of your neurodivergency.
The fact that you are going back to class is huge. Good luck. And your bangs are killer.
You seem like such a kind, gentle and caring soul. The world needs more people like this in nursing. Be kind and caring to yourself. Go at your own pace and believe in yourself.
I can't say I know what you're feeling, because I don't. But I believe that you'll be able to do this, so keep trying! You'll get through this 😁
Hugs, maybe they have a pt option for students with disabilities or medically supported rationale.  Never hurts to ask.  School is hard work and a lot of people are really understanding of the stress that comes with it.  More hugs, good for you for all the hard work you have already done!  Maybe a different program still in medical field might be your calling/suite you better?
It's easier said than done but don't let one part of your personality dictate the direction of your life. You made it this far which means you had to work hard, this will be more demanding but you're capable of it. Now go out there and give it hell!!
Just the fact that you are trying to help others, despite your own difficulties says a million things of you.   
For most of my life I have been in contact with nurses and caretakers in different capacities.   
(My father has been wheelchair bound since I was 5 years old.)   


The job can be hard at times, but know that the people you help will love you with all their hearts for you doing it, despite that some may find it difficult to show it to you.   


And in terms of jobs, with the degrees you are getting there are loads of directions you can go!   
There are heavy workload jobs, like working in first aid, but then there are degrees down as well. And any patient you help will appreciate everything you do.   


I hope you learned a lot during your second class!   


Keep at it! You can do it.   
Too many people look down on that profession, but for me, you are a hero. Just like you will be for all the people you will help in your life! :)
My girlfriend is bipolar and got through her classes. I think you'll be fine.

I am not saying it will be easy, as it wasn't easy for her, but she did get through it and I am sure you can too

Edit: You're really pretty, btw.
I can't imagine what it's like being bipolar. I've known people who were, one of my cousins is even, and I still can't imagine living with it, but I think you can do anything you put your mind to. It'll be rough, but you're an intelligent woman and you're amazing to get this far. I also love your style!
Don't worry you got this.
Try your next class and see if you can get through it. Keep doing that for each class. Conquer them 1 at a time.
Hang in there, nursing gives you purpose greater than yourself. Talk to your doctor about adjusting the meds to help with the new life stressors and throw yourself into your school. If nursing isn't for you because it's just not your thing? That's ok too. Good luck kiddo. Your going to do great things.
Someone once told me something I'll never forget: rest, don't quit.

Also, you're so beautiful! Those bangs looks so great on you! I really wish I could wear bangs too, but few people can actually pull them off. I love those piercings too. You look badass!
You're what strength looks like. Upvote x infinity
If you need time to help yourself mentally then give it to yourself. No matter what the result is, remember that you are worth the self care and that’s it’s better to live life with happiness even if you don’t always get what u want
It’s natural to feel overwhelmed by a new course of study, and even with your being bipolar, you’re good enough!
Girl, I can’t speak to being bipolar, but I think you’re amazing for sticking to it and working on your dreams. Please utilize your school’s mental health resources. They are there to help you succeed!!
You can do this. And doing it will give you SO much more self respect and confidence. I just completed 2+ years of school to become an x-ray technologist (similar course load and clinical schedule to nursing) and, although it was very difficult, I could not be happier with myself. If I can do it (I won't even go into all my stuff) you can do it! It always seems so daunting and impossible at first. But it gets so much better once you get a grasp on how things will really go. Show yourself what you're capable of!!!!
You will get used to it
It’s overwhelming but don’t give up! You can do this. The fact that you are going back for classes even after this happened says SO much. You got this girl!
Girl those eyebrows! 😍
You can def do it 

I know lots of RNs - it’s hard but you’ll get there
Check with your school’s academic counsellors about accommodations that will help you be successful.  Most colleges and universities happily accommodate students’ special needs and you’re entitled to the help.  

I’m proud that you’re going back for your afternoon class, even when the morning was overwhelming.  That’s amazing, even if it doesn’t feel that way right now!
It's not easy, but you can do more than you think that you can. It takes time to get used to a new routine. You will find that it gets easier when you adjust to your new routine. 
I said a prayer for you!
Dem eyes ♥️
Good you figured it out before you wasted money and time. It’s excellent you know who you are. This coupled with your incredible appearance, You will go far. Enjoy your journey!
Bipolar nurse here! Try it out and see how it goes. Your mental health is #1, and nursing can be very demanding and stressful. But I’m an LVN and I work in a hospice company and my job is chill and awesome. 

If you’re in an RN program and it’s too much, maybe LVN is better for you. 


But if you really want it, do it. Just see how it goes! Don’t get overwhelmed and tell yourself it now or never and this or nothing. Because you have a lot of options.  Give yourself some time to acclimate and if you want to try something else, it’s all good. But nursing can be awesome and fun, it doesn’t have to be crazy busy and stressful. ❤️❤️


Forgot to add, talk to your psychiatrist/therapist about it and get their opinion and ask for ideas for coping mechanisms and what to do when feeling overwhelmed. Life is great even with BD. I am living proof. Much love.
Hang in there love. Cheering for you!
You got this.
You can do anything you put your mind to girl! I believe in you! Ps love your ear piercings
From your post history you seem like you’ve got a great sense of humour. :)
There’s nothing wrong with trying something and having yourself think it’s not for you, it’s the first day and maybe after you acquire the knowledge it will become easier. And on the flip side of you don’t enjoy it, you absolutely don’t have to stick to it! You’re a strong woman . Don’t forget that. :)
Give it time, you’ve already come this far :)
I'm sorry you're having a rough time.  Sometimes a bad first day is just a bad first day, and all it means is the universe is pushing your limits and making you stronger.  Don't give up, but remember that whatever you decide is the right thing to do, there are people around you to help and support you.

Hope your second class is better than the first. Good luck!
Since when can bipolar people not do homework or write essays? You can do it girl!!!! They make it hard to weed people out
You can do this. It's going to be really challenging and you may need some help, but you CAN do this!!
Im sure you can do it! And also, your style.. wow
The first day is always overwhelming. No matter what classes. Don’t give up. Give yourself a chance. The more you try the less it will pressure you. Don’t let your bipolar boss you around. I had to learn that with my depression. You can do it. Maybe if you take it a little slower at first it would help. My prayers are with you.
Yo you are gonna be fine my dude, words don't immediately solve the problem but it seems you got a whole lotta love comin' from the community so good luck and you got this.
You got this!
Just keep going.
Ur hot
There are over 153 comments on this post. Not sure if you're going to read this particular one but I have to tell you that you're very beautiful :) 

Also I would love to chat if you'd be interested in a 23 year old computer science undergraduate from Pakistan
damn she's hot
You are beautiful!
You are very beautiful and I believe in you and I think you will be a very good nurse and the bipolarism will doesn't be an obstacle if you think then you are stronger (sory if I have a bad English)
Good luck
You remind me of Abby from NCIS.

I think you should run with that, get some fuckoff-huge stompey boots and walk all over those classes. You made it through your first day. That's huge. You'll handle the next day even better.

Never forget: you are the culmination of evolution. Your very being is proof that you are one of the biggest badasses in existence. You have defeated every challenge that life has ever thrown at you, and you have come out on top of *all* of them. Your obstacles are a mountain that you stand at the peak of, and here you are, just looking for a new one to conquer.

You are a magic skeleton made of stardust and powered by electricity. Your reach is already vast, and there is *nothing* beyond your grasp.
A nursing course will be difficult as you know, but the biggest part of the workload is all the required reading.
With bipolar, I imagine the meds sap you of mental energy.
Be sure to register with your special needs department for assistance. They may be able to arrange accommodations that will make your workload a little more bearable.
It will be difficult, but stick to your meds, get enough sleep and be sure to eat a proper diet.
If you pace yourself, you should be able to do it.
Just the fact you chose this field of study makes me proud of you.
You are a very kind man, Andrew.
Thanks man I really needed to hear this today
Also, feel free to message me if you wanna talk bips stuff.

And r/bipolar and r/bipolar2 are both great.
Thanks man
Thanks man ❤️
Thankyou I really needed this today
You best believe I'm gonna go back in my black Steel caps and make this shit work!
Can confirm. He's the kind of person we need more of and one of the only male redditors who has PMd me and has not been a creep. 

And I concur with his statement. And I think you can do this, OP. 

I think also you should go to disability services and see if there's anything they can do to help you as well and get in touch with the campus counseling center if you're not already set up with a therapist. Bipolar is also often responsive to medication, so if you're not trying that avenue, maybe now is the time. Or maybe it's time for a change in meds if your disorder is unaffected. 

Getting ahead of your disorder in this way will be a way of preparing for it and hopefully, ultimately not letting it get the better of you. I struggled and still do struggle with school due to mental illness. I'm in grad school now, have Major Depressive Disorder. Generalized Anxiety Disorder, PTSD  and Borderline, and on top of all that am homeless right now and have been for the better part of a year. And I know that's different. Bipolar is hard and it's debilitating in a way my disorders are not. But I want you to know it is possible. It's very hard. It takes mad dedication. But you're already dedicated if you want to be a nurse, I bet. 

And finally, you're beautiful! You look like a caring person and I'd be happy if you came into my room as my nurse. I'd feel relaxed immediately just because you give off a calm, sweetheart vibe. 

Good luck! And dont forget to post in a few years showing us all that diploma. ♡♡♡
Anytime bud. I think it’s incumbent on us, who’ve the experience, to impart the wisdom we’ve accumulated over the course of our travails. Just internalise your awesomeness (easier said than done, I know), and I’m sure you’ll surprise yourself with how capable you are.
Fuckin right you are! You've got a cheerleader over here. :)
You're so nice u/sylvanwhisper! OP is an amazing person! She said some of the best words of wisdom to me (who was trying to cheer her up) and I ended up being encouraged by her.

I'm just respectful. You know I did have a ldr gf who I met here... So... I think there's a place for flirting also! But not when someone's feeling blue!
You might feel shaky, but you're looking sharp as a razor. That old school cool vibe isn't something everyone can pull off. You rock it well.
You look wonderful already, think how wonderful you will look and *feel* with a bit more weight on you. One thing I have really learned in the last couple of months is that a couple extra pounds wont mean the difference between others loving you or not, others thinking you are attractive or not, etc, etc

I really recommend Huel, has really helped me to stop freaking out about my meals and gain some weight from my anorexia. 

All my best xxx
I'm so proud of you! Your journey is your own but so many people you don't know love and support you for real. Good luck with your body image and please know the work is worth it.
You look amazing, and smartly dressed too! I'm trans too, so I know it's tough, but I think you can get through it with some style and elegance. :)
Totally dig your look, friend.

Your picture made me smile.

Have a good week.

Sending love, happiness, and encouragement.

Cheers.
I can tell you’re a super cool person! Hang in there. The world has amazing things in store for you. It’s a good idea to keep working on your health so you can meet all those opportunities head on. Proud of you!
I love the hat! I could never pull that off, but you sure rock it. Recovering from eating disorders is tough and there’s a lot of uncomfortable emotions involved, but keep your head up! You got this ❤️
Absolutely stunnung! You look fantastic, you're thinking positive, you're trying your best, and you're absolutely gorgeous, you don't need us, but thanks for giving us a chance to try and help! Stay out there and keep on keepin on.
I love your outfit
I like your style, I feel strong English vibe in it!!!

I you truly want something you'll get it. Focus on what matter for you and believe in yourself
Your style is amazing. Recovery is always the best thing and I am so glad you are currently on track. Don’t let your fears hold you back, you are so strong and can make it through this. We all believe in you!
Tyvm, no one has told me that before! I dont dress like this all the time but sometimes it’s nice to wear a vest
Tysm! I’ve been finally gaining weight the past 2-3 weeks and I’m definitely starting to feel a lot better! I do fear that people will stop respecting/loving me if I gain weight, so ty for the reassurance
Ty! I’m trying to relearn that I’M worth it, that I’m worth working on
Ty so much, that means a lot to me. Trans solidarity!
Ty for well wishes~ I’m glad I made someone smile
Ty this is a hopeful thing to say. I’m always scared that my future is going to go downhill and be full of bad thinfs but I try to tell myself I don’t know that
Tysm for the encouragement <3
Tyvm!
Ty I’m glad people seem to love it
Ty, I’m so overcome that people like my outfit, itms one of my favorites! 

Yeah I’m trying to find things that matter to me and worth living for
Ty! Recovery IS the best thing, I’m starting to come around to that
Yeah! \*Sends internet hugs!\*
It’s easy to think about bad things more than good things. There will always be some bad things, but you’ve always gotten through it so far. You can take everything you’ve been through and turn it into your fuel for a brighter future. Good things will happen, no matter what.
Anytime! Hope your day is going good.
I'll let you in on a little secret, your professors are just as nervous and scared an unsure of themselves as you are. I remember my first meeting with other profs before I taught my first class and even professors with decades under their belts admitted they sometimes feel like impostors. So if you ever feel overwhelmed and wonder if you belong just know that even the double doctorates with 40 years of teaching under their belts sometimes feel the same way. You are obviously a pretty young woman with a lovely smile. You will make friends and memories, and while you might always have these doubts just know that they are normal.
You should be looking forward to uni. It's a chance for a new start. Think of the new friends you are going to make and all the clubs you could join. Chin up and dont be afraid to try new clubs.
Hello, beautiful!

Don't worry about uni. You will be able to make it through. It's normal to feel scared and insignificant, but you will find something that you excel at, and you will find friends!

And let me fill you in on  a secret: Don't compare yourself to your peers. No one on this planet actually knows what the hell they are doing, chances are that any good things that you have seen happen have been luck. Or exaggerated. 

Oh, and keep in mind that even if your friends do have big accomplishments, that in NO WAY negates yours. 

Keep your head up.
Uni is a great place to start new or build on yourself in ways you never knew were possible! It’s hard to see your good qualities when the negative self talk starts blabbing, but you really are not an evil worthless person I promise! You have a fantastic smile! You’re about to embark on a new part of life and learn and grow and change so quickly! Your early 20s are so much fun and so hectic and interesting so embrace it :) I hope you have a great week and a fantastic time in school!
You look super cute, and I hope you have a great time at uni. Where you going?
Thank you for that💚
I'm going to be part of a marching band for the first time... I'm so scared because I've never done it before, but I'm excited. ❤️
Thank you so much ❤️ ❤️❤️
You're welcome! I hope you have a great day :)
Ma'am you are a beautiful, wonderful, nurturing woman who should be treated like gold.  You deserve to be loved and to experience true happiness.  You need not feel any culpability in the dissolution of your relationship.  He fulfills the criteria of a narcissist and a user and it sounds like he has little interest in changing.  You're a kind-hearted person and your father just have been a wonderful man to have raised such an equally wonderful daughter.  You deserve to fulfill your dreams and to be accompanied by someone who loves and cherishes, rather than someone who abuses alcohol and blames you for all of his shortcomings.
Forgive me, but I crept through your post and comment history because sometimes it can be hard to give a genuine toast based on one picture.

I want to tell you that I think you are incredibly resilient. Life has its ups and downs for everyone but some of the battles you have fought in the last few years can’t have been easy. Yet everything you post has an air of optimism and really shows you to be an intelligent and caring person. Those are some of the best qualities anyone can hope to have and you have them. Many people let lesser things ruin them but you have kept going strong despite some personal hardships. I really admire that about you.

Keep your head up, there’s no doubt in my mind that you are a positive influence on the people around you and the world. You aren’t a quitter and this internet stranger is rooting for you to make it through this rough patch and on to happier days. They are coming. You are a strong woman

Also, for what it’s worth I think you continue to get more beautiful with passing time. You have a good sense of style and a beautiful smile. The nose ring is super cute and I’m all guy, I don’t know much about hair and eyebrows and stuff like that but even I know yours is on point.
Your smile is intimidatingly stunning and that shirt is 🔥. Also your eyebrow game is on point.
You seem huggable. Like the person you meet at a friends place, where you spend 12 hours just talking about... cucumbers? I don't know. Then a nail? Anyway, you got a personality that shines through a picture, and that's rare. You rock
You're freaking gorgeous!! Hope things get better ❤️
Through those eyes I see a sweet, strong woman.
Things are usually tough and wild in people's 20's, but if you stay tough and keep making good decisions, everything generally falls into place after a while.  Good luck with things!
You are a beautiful woman. You have a great smile and I bet full on would light up any room. Keep your chin stay positive and things will get better. Come see us if you need some further encouragement 🌹
I can comment on how attractive you are, but I am pretty sure you are well aware of just how much you brighten the day of others with your physical appearance.

On the note of your troubles young lady, feel free to post on r/advise or on here if you ever need someone to talk to about what's keeping you down. As often times just having someone who is willing to listen and relate is enough to make all the difference.
Hang in there. Better times are ahead. You’re a stunning woman.
Your hair 😍
That shirt is just like your smile - killer! You also have amazing hair, that's a very rich and vibrant color!
Your eyeliner is amazing! I can never get mine to be that even and sharp. Know that even though it’s tough right now, things will get better. My mantra is a quote I heard a while back: “everything will be okay in the end. If it’s not okay, it’s not the end” :)
Hello! Just stopping in to say hello and let you know you're absolutely gorgeous! Also, LOVE that shirt!
Hey, after reading through your post history, I realize how incredibly strong, resilient, and caring you are. I hope you are doing better soon, I’m sending so much love and positive vibes your way because you really really deserve it. I hope you’re able to take some time for yourself and do things you like to do and eat foods you like to eat and rest if you need it. Stay strong! Hope you have a fantastic week!
Life can be really tough at times. But i find at times like this its best to pull out and look at the big picture. These things come in waves and they’ll go back out eventually. Things will get better.
Your very pretty, I hope you can take your black toast and turn it in to a toast of gold.
Hell dude, 90 hours a week? Holy shit. I hope you’ve been getting a lot of rest and staying hydrated. Sucks about your mom but I’m no stranger to parental drug use. It’ll get better hopefully. You’re also a handsome guy man. I also have a kitten and I love the hell out of my little man. Cats are great! What do you do for your job? Give it a smile next picture 🙃
Well to point out the obvious and least important things , you’re super handsome and you have amazing skin!!! 

Have you already seen what your new kitten looks like? What colour is it ? He or she will definitely keep your spirits up! :) do you have any other pets ? 

I’m sorry about your mom. It’s upsetting that you think you’re not going anywhere in life . You work 90hours a week, that’s more hours than any man I’ve ever known. Don’t be so hard on yourself you should be really proud of yourself . Working that hard while also dealing with family drama is a lot ! 

Hope you’re taking care of yourself on your down time away from work and your moms troubles. Doing things you enjoy doing. Extremely important if you want to keep your sanity lol 💕
Well, that sucks. It really does. I would love to be all "yeah, but 90 hours is better than 100, innit? " and it sucks. 

But what doesn't suck is the outcome. You may not see it as such, but it shows your character. It shows a guy that would go far for what he believes. A dedicated and good man. 

Your eyes tell me you are one to listen to, because you got some brains. Good looking out mate
You have kind eyes! Hang in there!
First off, I’m so fucking sorry you gotta work 90 hours a week. No one deserves that and I’m sorry the system sucks :(

But, on a more positive note, your hair is nice af and you have nice, even, blemish free skin :)
90 hours a week?!  Dude, you're a *monster*... I wish I had half of your drive and energy to be able to pull that off.  With that kind of work ethic, I'm sure things will play into something better for you if you just keep playing your cards right.  Strength like that is *rare*.
You have really lovely and kind eyes.
I literally can't imagine how tired you must feel on a daily basis. I ache just imagining it. It's gotta be rough, but you're handsome, and you're very strong willed to have broken your addiction. I don't think you can keep this workload up forever, so it's smart that you've got this financial advisor to help you. Maybe you can set up a comfortable nest egg for later.
What is it you want to do? You sound like someone who is not happy where they are at, so if it is tech-related, let me know. Maybe I can help.
The first two sentences of this title make you a better man than 99% of the population. I feel like a beta complaining about the little problems I have. I truly hope things get better for you brother, because you sure as hell deserve it.
Coming from a woman, you have very kind eyes and a welcoming smile! You give off nonthreatening vibes in a good way, like somebody who would give great hugs! Also, you clearly have an amazing work ethic to be able to make working 90+ hour weeks doable. I had a difficult time making 60 work! You’re honestly doing really great as far as that goes, and your diligence will not go unnoticed! Keep your chin up, good things are coming for you.
Edit: I realize now that you aren’t even physically smiling, your eyes are just very expressive of your clear inherent goodness! Props.
For starters, that handsome ass face aint half bad to have on a rainy day. Second, who knows where we're going in life? You only ever know where you wanna be when you really get there yanno? Do what you gotta do, keep chasing those passions, kiss a girl, kiss a guy, do what you gotta do friend. If you have to work your life away for now, make it up later when you have the time. I know this is hippy dippy "just think positive" bullshit but aye man, i'm just hopin for the best for ya!
You're very handsome! I mean, look at that cool ass hair, kind and beautiful eyes, ideal lips and great skin. Also, as a fellow opiate addict in recovery (1 year sober), don't ever forget how far you've come and how much better of a person you are now. Give yourself credit for that, and hold your head high. Since getting clean, I've had to find new ways to make myself happy. Remember, practice self-care. Find something you enjoy that you can get into, even if it's only for 1 hour per day. YouTube videos are a mini release for me. Whether you want something funny, interesting, motivational, creepy or educational... it's all there. Music has practically saved my life. Oh, and I'm incredibly jealous of your new fur baby. =)
just want to say that a kitten is a lot of work and you definitely need to be around more than 10 or 20 hours a week. besides that hope things work out for you
Kittens are awesome. Also. Your hair is pretty awesome too.
You are adopting a kitten!!! That's more happiness than you had before! It's the little things in life that count!
It takes serious commitment to work 90+ hours a week, and you have that! You’re a really hardworking man, and that’s something i can’t say for myself, so you should take pride in that. I’m sure you’ll be a great cat dad too!
Wow, you have clearly been through a lot, but you are still standing strong. And also, damn your skin is glowing. I have a thorough skin care routine yet you have way better skin than me. What's your secret?

I find it very positive that you are getting a kitten. I bet you'll be an awesome cat dad and a great companion.
Hey dude, sorry to hear about your mom. I hope she gets the help she needs and gets better soon. I’m so happy to hear you’ll be getting a kitten! They’re such good pals and it’ll love you so so much! It’s amazing how good it feels when you get home and crash and your cat friend is there to curl up with you and chill. Also, Navi is such a good name! Is it a Zelda reference? If so... good taste :P if you ever need someone to talk to I’m always free to lend an ear and make a friend! I hope this week treats ya well! :3
Working like that is tough man. Stay strong, and take care of that kitten!
I see that you’re here putting yourself out there in this group and you fucking WANT things to get better. Honestly dude, I can tell you’re going to be okay.
Yeah, oil is worse than the military.. lol stayin hydrated for sure! I get 5-6 of sleep on a good night though. I can't help getting off of work and sitting if front of the TV for an hour or two after work. Feels like the only thing that breaks my days apart other than sleep. For my mom, I know I dont hate her, I hate her addiction but it's really hard to separate those two sometimes... and for the kitty, I'm stoked, she's a little lynx kitten and I think I'll name her Navi. I just hope me working so many hours doesn't affect her too much. She'll have a big sister to take care of her though. thank you for the compliment btw (:
No one's ever commented on my skin (: 

She's a siamese lynx so she's all white with grey stripes on her tail legs and face with bright blue eyes 😻 I've only seen pictures of her on the internet but I can just tell she'll fit right into the family (my gf and other cat) I'm seriously so excited to get her.

It's ok, I just remember growning up having so much fun with my mom. I was about 13 when she started letting herself go though, so I'm pretty used to it now. I'm just frustrated I cant be there to help and my little sister has to deal with all of it.

I definitely get off of work and do some fun things, which has it's down sides though. I dont get much sleep anymore... lol

Anyways, thank you for all of your kind words!
Thank you. I don't hear that much.
It's like upper management likes to put us through hell. They say yes to the impossible and we accomplish it just to make them look good with no reward other that the government taxing the hell out of our overtime. It's a fucked system is what it is. Stay in school kids, no one deserves this. 

Thank you, I've been slicking it back for only a couple months now because it was tickling my face and driving me nuts and I'm never cutting it short again after the military lol and for my skin, my secret is only wash with water. Soap dries my skin up and cause breakouts.
Thank you! Tbh, I dont wash my face with any product. I just make sure my hands are super clean and gently scrub with my hands in the shower (: it does take a little while for your natural oils to balance out, so expect a couple break outs until then.  

I'm super stoked about the kitten, she'll be a great addition to the family (another cat)
She was 6 months sober this last time before she went back to drinking. The whole family was coming together again and pretty much fell apart in one day. My dad enables all of it and holds it against her. But this has been going on for 20 years so I'm pretty much fed up with it. I just hope she gets better soon, there's so much life happening right now.. And yes!! Navi from Zelda (: you're the only one who gotten that! Lol I'll absolutely take you up on that offer, you have definitely made my day a little better, thank you (:
Hey man must be good money for ya to be crushing them hours out. 90 a week how many hours a Day is that? Of course man. And that’s a cute ass name. And I know man. Your mom and her addiction tie hand in hand and it sucks sometimes. Especially seeing our family struggle like that.. life is hard and all we ever wanna do is drown it out :/
I guess that is why you are here. I meant every word. You look good man  nohomo😉
Lmao! My husband does the exact same thing for his skin! He has lighter skin that’s more sensitive like yours. It blew my mind when he told me that. 

I have olive skin that’s more oily, so I have to use oil reducing acne wash. But now that I’m an adult I’m blemish free too thank god.

And yeah I feel you on the work thing. That’s why r/antiwork is a good place to vent lol.
I’m so sorry to hear that... it’s so so hard to watch someone you care about struggle. ): I hope that down the road she can be clean and realize what a great supportive son she has. Also, I’m so surprised no one caught on to the Zelda thing! Maybe I just have video games on the brain haha. I’m glad I was able to brighten your day! 😊
You would think I was saving a bunch of money! Lol I mean I'm not struggling to make ends meet but I'm not good with saving the rest. I honestly don't know where it all goes! I recently got a financial advisor though, so maybe we can iron out some of that. I'm working 14 hours a day give or take depending on the day, 12 on 2 off. And I get what she's going through, truly. I was an opiate addict and have been clean for two years. I just know what it does to people on the outside and never want to put anyone else through that again. I feel like my mom just doesn't care about what it does to us.
Lol r/antiwork is amazing, thank you for showing me that. Makes me feel a little less alone (:
I don’t know the whole situation but once you’re that far down the rabbit hole you just never notice the affects or if you do you’re too high too care. I’m glad you’re clean man! Best thing for ya. Couldn’t be working those long weeks still high.
Darling you matter and you are worthy. You matter a lot. Reach out for professional help, you can get better but you need to ask for help.
You are enough. You were born enough. You will always matter, you matter to me now enough to be typing this when I should be sleeping. Life can be amazing, give it a shot.


Sending a super big healing hug 🤗
i’m sorry that you’re going through that. as someone who’s been through (and is still going through) those struggles, i know it’s hard to stay positive and push through. you are good enough. you just being alive is good enough! if you ever need to talk to another teen about anything, i’m always available to message on reddit. i know this stuff is hard to go through alone, but you’ve got this!
First of all, you look really cute. Secondly, there is no such thing as good enough. You’re here, you’re who you are, it doesn’t matter if you’re good enough, cause you’re doing your best and that’s gonna have to be good enough.
It’s awful that you’re going through this at 15. I really hope you have good people in your life to support you. You honestly look perfectly fine, and you should be happy with yourself! If others can’t see that, they aren’t worth your time.
hugs are the best thank you!
thank you it means a lot
Dude; you look unquestionably male to me. College is hard, especially when you have to deal with depression and dysphoria, but just hang in there and it’ll get better. HRT truly does help so much.

I’m sure you’ll have no trouble passing in either sense of the word. Good luck!
Look like a guy to me. Didn't think girl when I saw your pic at all. Had to read what you wrote to know.
You are enough. 


I’m gay. We are in the same community. That’s something I wish I’d heard, and I want you to know that. Your value is not defined by how others perceive you, or your gender. You are awesome just as you are and as the genuine version of you, a more beautiful life with grow AROUND you with time. Do not conform to the life you have. Give it time.
What are you taking in school?
Never would I have guessed that you were not male. You got this! Good luck to you
I'm transgender myself, and so I know how you feel. I'm not out yet, and I'm not on hormones either, but I have been dabbling with different ways to feel more feminine, including even wearing nail polish. When I do, I feel better about myself, but I also feel naked.. like people can see right through me. It's rough, but I just need to get outside of my own head. You can definitely pass for male, you've got a sort of Michael Shanks (from SG-1) vibe.  


EDIT: I forgot to say, please please please don't try to do that to yourself again. Suicide claims far too many of us, and it always breaks my heart and makes me cry to hear of more. We need beautiful souls like you in this world.
Wow. You really look like a guy. I wouldn’t believe you if you said u were a female.
dude before i read the caption i thought you were a guy. u look great!
Hey, I know most people have said this but man, you really pass! :) I’m sure T will help you even more down the road (emotionally and physically!) I also want to say CONGRATS at almost being through school! That’s a MAJOR accomplishment! So proud of you and rooting for you! If you ever need a friend to talk with or vent to I’m always open for a conversation! Otherwise keep a smile on your face cuz YOUVE GOT THIS!
I looked at the picture before I read the title, and I definitely saw a man.
You pass!! And even if you didn't, there is no rule that dictates how a person should look to fit into a gender. You are enough, good enough, and strong enough whether you are on T or not. You can make it through! 

And you will always have a home in the LGBT+ Community.
Im gonna be honest, i saw the pic before reading it and you pass fricking well 👌please don't do anything you'll regret theres so many people who care about you and im sure would be happy to talk, here 4 you if you need someone to talk to :D
You pass far better than you realize! Coming out is a huge step, and you should be super proud of yourself- it takes a lot of bravery to do something like that. You are strong and smart and you can crush this coming semester!
You're a gorgeous young man!
One of my best friends just came out as trans and holy shit seeing her out was like seeing her soul for the first time. She’s become this confident, outgoing person and I don’t think she even realizes that anything has seemed to have changed. You’re going to pass, and that’s because it’s just who you are. Under all the exterior bullshit it’s just fucking true. And as I learned recently, its pretty damn easy to see when a person is living in who they are. Keep going. You’re a badass for coming this far.
I'm a Writing major!
Thank you! I've done everything short of hormones/surgery, but the self hating part of me worries regardless.
Thank you!
What that's awesome! Congrats! You're doing like a huge transition in your life in more ways than one. I don't know how either of these things feel but I imagine it's a tad scary and stressful. I think you are super cute and I hope it all goes as well as possible.
It's far too easy for us to find reasons to hate ourselves, you need to look for things you love about yourself. You're an amazing man, and you're so brave to be taking this road! I know just how hard it is, and I also know from experience that most trans people I've met had the brightest, loveliest hearts. Look at that smile, you have an inner warmth and kindness that shines through!
Thank you!!
Aw you're gonna make me cry! That's really sweet of you. 

By the way, if you need someone to talk to, my DMs are open. I snooped through your post history (genuine curiosity, not anything malicious!) and saw you're having a rough time. Maybe we could lean on each other? Just a thought.
Thank you. Yeah, my life is pretty rough right now, but I try to keep a positive outlook and not worry about my issues, which leads to less stress at least. I'm open to DM's though, yeah. I just found this reddit last night but it's felt so good connecting with people like this, and trying to help brighten their days.
It's wonderful to help other people, agreed!
Hang in there :) you have pretty eye color and nice full lips! Also nice wavy hair.

Moving isn’t all bad. Sometimes it’s the door to something better, you just don’t know it yet. I always dreaded moving, but I wouldn’t be where I am right now without any of those moves. It finally paid off!
Woah. I am sending you a spiritual "Hang In There, Baby!" motivational cat poster. Also you have good hair
your hair is amazing, what shampoo do you use? I'm not saying this just because you asked to be toasted, I am genuinely wondering. your hair is actually so t h i c c c c c c c and shiny.

&#x200B;

and you have a really nice face. idk I know this is all purely shallow but I don't know you that well. you seem like a nice person though. hang in there! you can get through this. I'm here for you anytime if you need to talk. 💚  💚  💚
have a lovey birthday.
I am sorry you are going through difficult times.
I wish you the best.
ur adorable
Hey! Happy birthday! I’m sending happy positive waves your way! I hope your move goes well, and this time next year you’re healthy, and on hormones, and happy. :) have a wonderful day friend!
Oh, you poor thing. I hope this issue doesn't permanently prevent you from receiving HRT. You are incredibly brave to share your problems here with everyone, and I know if you start HRT someday, you'll be even more amazing! Shine on like a diamond. :)
Happy birthday and I wish you the best of luck beating your medical condition, moving etc
Damn dude you look ready to take on the world! And btw I looked at your profile and I couldn’t tell you were ftm
And you still look so good after all that? Goddamn fam
I use Pantene. But I think I was just blessed by Dionysus 🙏🏻

Thanks ❤️
It shouldn’t permanently prevent me from HRT, it just felt like another blow on top of everything. Thank you kind stranger! :)
I'm trans myself, so I really feel for you. I hope you have an amazing day and good luck! EDIT: Oh yeah, happy birthday too!
Filters can't hide real beauty. You'd be beautiful without them.
I know it hurts to find out the people you thought were friends were fake.
I don't know the details, but please don't blame yourself for it. You look like a nice person to talk to, so I'm sure you have no problem getting along with the people you like - and if people are being fake, fuck'em.

You're gorgeous and you would definitely be even without filters!
Hang in there. Keep looking and you’ll find good friends. You make a good friend, by the way
Here's 2 things you don't need: filters and those fake friends. Don't the fake ones make you feel bad about yourself, and maybe cut a few ties with them. And filters are ok, but you shouldn't rely on them, especially when you're so amazing!
I get ghosted incessantly. I can tell you this, it doesn't make you a bad person. It makes you someone with a big heart who doesn't take friendships lightly. The good people of this sub would never ghost you.
You are beautiful and you can see that beyond the filters
dude... we're in the same boat. you honestly seem like a really nice person. I would totally want to be your friend. and you are too good for those fakers. they clearly don;t realize how good of a person you are, and if they go on being like this you might as well just ditch them for better friends. and I'm sure you're just as beautiful without the filters. your eyebrow game is very strong my dude. 

&#x200B;

anyways. I'm here for you anytime if you need to talk. hope you have a wonderful day/night.  💚  💚  💚
Your eyes are really pretty! Ever heard of r/eyes maybe you could start small and take a picture of just your eyes without a filter. ✌️❤️
hey, i'm sorry about the shitty action of the "friends". as someone who's also struggled with finding loyalty and their people, just keep in mind the idea that it's better to be alone than in bad company. it's not always EASY or comfortable to be alone, but it's a nice chance to get more okay with it, to know yourself better, and become a better friend to you. keep that in the back of your head and also remember that one day, you'll have your people.
Why would anyone ghost you? You are beautiful and I’m sure fun to be around. Ultimately gorgeous it’s their loss not yours.🌹
Selfies are over-rated. Fock em
You are very beautiful, you doesn't need a filter 
And about the friend people come and leave you stil have a family and one hope you will find someone who are not fake
Ghosting is awful. I've been guilty of it myself, and it is not something I'm proud of. It's convenient, but WRONG. I'm sorry that you've been dealing with it. You have piercing eyes, and they are fantastic
Your jawline is perfect and your hair is cool af
You look like Jesus with different hair color but better
Your eyes are gorgeous! Just know that gaining weight doesn’t diminish the kind of person you are, you are still beutiful regardless of what you weight! Own your body, its yours and its beutiful. Plus, just know that theres people out there that love you and mental health issues are a scary and dificult thing that you are a survivor of for living with them. I hope the best for you,
Hey there. Your big brown eyes are beautiful. And I really like your glasses. My advice would be to think about your surroundings (work/home/people/friends) and ask yourself if you were to leave it and find something different/new would you be ok? And TELL yourself YES you would be. Change is good and can heal you in ways you never thought possible. Much love!
Hey, just wanted to say you have really smooth skin and gorgeous eyes! Just keep in mind that weight fluctuates and it's perfectly normal to have ups and downs. The same goes for mental health. It's only a matter of time before things get better!
Like you, I've suffered from a mysterious medical condition that was misdiagnosed for several years.  Be persistent, don't give up on your quest for the truth.  If you don't get answers from one doctor, seek the opinion of a second, or a third, or a fourth, or however many it takes for you to get the proper diagnosis.  You're worth it, and your heart is full of love, even if you have a heart condition.
If your a girl you are cute
I love ur glasses!! Very Cute : ) I am highkey attached to the people who work at my local taco bell too, so ur hats makin me smile too. Stay strong, mental health is one of those things that can totally fluctuate. Give it time and take care of yourself when you can. u are definitely worth it.
You’re adorable.
After a quick look at your profile, I definitely want to hang out with you sometime. Trust me, you’re gonna be fine
Nice hair cut dude.
Edit *not as serious as
You look like a really mature, dependable 16 year old and self deprecating people are the best - always really dry and funny! Also, you're going to be one of those men who grows into their looks and ends up as a heartbreaker at 25...
ur nose is so cute!
Thanks
In all honesty I read it as hair cat for a second 😂
Sorry I don't understand what do you mean by heartbreaker in this context
Thanks
I think you're going to end up really handsome! Haha sorry for my UK English
Oh sorry I didn't understand before thanks tho😄
I could just stare at your eyes like a totally insane person, OR THE SANEST PERSON EVER, for hours. Your lips are like harrowed poetry, filled with love and hurt.
Not sure why people going in and negatively voting comments here. I appreciate all of them.
You don't need negativity like that. You're awesome and she clearly doesn't realize that. I'm sure she ripped out a piece of your heart when she packed up her stuff, but you're resilient. You're a survivor. And if it's one thing you definitely are it's that you're better off without her. Time will heal wounds but you deserve to be in company of people who do know you're worth a damn. And not just any damn. I'd say a "hot damn". You're worth so much more than someone could ever say because only you know your own selfworth because it is you alone who defines your selfworth. I'm sorry it's going to be tough for awhile but here's to you! Here's to a change of higher standards! Here's to you showing the rest of the world what you've known your whole life: you are beyond awesome! And here's to all the other people you will find along the way that know that as well! Cheers!
You have the jawline I want and you have the eyes of a fantasy character.
You are beautiful, and you have a lot to contribute to the world and others. She's obviously missing out, but that's her mistake to make. Don't think of it as losing something, because if she's not able to appreciate having someone amazing like you in her life, she's only wasting your time in the long run. I know that it hurts, but try to do things for yourself that will make you happy, you deserve to pamper yourself. Have an amazing day!
I'm really sorry about your ex. she doesn't deserve someone as good as you. there's probably a better girl out there for you. you might feel heartbroken right now, but you are strong! you can get through this. I'm here for you anytime if you need to talk.  💚  💚  💚 

&#x200B;

side note: you are like. the most beautiful person I have ever seen. your eyes are such a beautiful color and your nose ring looks amazing on your.
So sorry about your ex... breakups suck... I know you are strong enough to get through it to the other side though :) it’s so hard to see it as new open door now, but sometimes the change that hurts the most is the change that’s needed. I know you’ll be doing great in a few weeks and will find someone who loves, respects and cherishes you as much as you cherish, respect and love them. I hope you have a wonderful week! Keep your chin up :)
You deserve better than someone who can (and did) just walk away without an explanation!! And you will find them!! 

&#x200B;

On a side note, you are gorgeous!
That was a shitty thing for her to do. Maybe just maybe you’re better off without her. You certainly deserve to be treated better.
You'll feel shitty now, and for a while, but I know you're strong enough to come out of this as a complete and resilient woman. Also, your eyes are the exact shade of blue that the sky is! Be strong, let yourself grieve for three years of your life  and PM me if you want to vent to a stranger 😺
When people want to walk away let them walk. She doesn't control your destiny. It's not that she's a bad person, it just means that her part of your story is over. You're a gorgeous woman who can have someone in your life who won't abandon you. Don't go chasing. Stay strong. You're in my thoughts.
You’re a gorgeous lady, there are so many women out there who you could make so happy. The end of anything is tough, especially when it’s unexpected, but life will continue on and better experiences will come out of it. Stay strong, I believe in you.
Honestly this made me cry. Thank you, I haven’t been complimented like this in years
T-t-t- toasted. Thank you. I just got out of therapy and seeing these comments is definitely what I needed. I am strong. I will get through this bullshit
Wow thank you so much. I appreciate that
Thank you, I know it’s far down the line but one day I’ll see that this happened for a reason. It’s becoming clear right now
She definitely has quite a bit of mental illness whatever that may be going on. I hope she gets help before it’s too late. That’s all I can hope for. I’ll be fine, just working on loving myself
You can hope, and help if she asks for it. And good for you, take care of yourself.
You look like a druid from dungeons and dragons. I hope that is a compliment for ya. I like fantasy.
You’re my type!! 😍
You also like Battlestar Galactic? Dude, just when I thought you couldn’t rock any harder, you go and rock even harder.

Thanks for being a ray of sunshine in this world.

Cheers.
Seeing you makes me happy 😊
You look like a genuine dude. Bonus points for the Metallica sign in the back.
Haha thanks 😊
Nice to know 😆
Thank you, I love BSG 😊
Aww thank you, that's sweet 😊
you look just fine! don’t let them get  you down <3 whoever colored your hair did a damn fine job, looks shiny and healthy :)
I’m sorry. Life is hard enough WITH parents support. Hang in there friend. It will get better, I promise.
They must be blind!! You’re really handsome!
You look great your choice of glasses are confusing me XD but in a good way i would find you interesting and would certainly have a talk if you aproached me. Have a great Day!
I’m sure that what your parents said/think hurts. But keep your head up. You are who you are, and you are wonderful. You touch the lives of those around you, even if you don’t realize it. Keep doing you and try to ignore the toxicity of those who are too small minded to accept you.
You look totally cute and your parents sound like real assholes. It sucks, but chosen family tends to be the reality for most folks in  our LGBT+ community. It's always getting better, but until it's completely safe, you have us!
Your parents are wrong first of all. You don't at all look like a he she. Just remember that not everyone in this world is bigoted and we can't choose our family but we CAN choose who we let into our lives. Go to a pride parade and I promise you will feel accepted. We are here for you <3
I wish I had your facial structure. Very handsome!
You are none of those things. I don’t understand how difficult it can be living as a trans person as I am cis, but I do know what it’s like being LGBT+, and I understand the struggle of not being accepted. You aren’t alone during these difficult times, if you ever need to talk pop by any trans subreddit, or the lgbt subreddit. We’re here for you. You’re very good looking by the way, I hope you’re doing okay dear.
My God the amount of bravery it takes to put up with that shit. Here's to that alone!

You're adorable. If you were sitting alone at a bar, I'd immediately try to buy you a drink assuming I don't trip in the process of walking over to you. Hopefully you'd talk to me and girlfriend. 99% sure you'd make an awesome friend. It's a good thing your parents don't have any taste in trans men because I wouldn't want them at the bar anyway. I'm sure they're black holes in more than just intellect and the ways of sex appeal. Also, you're cute. They're dense. And, now, I kind of wish I went to bars in the first place. Cheers! To someone who actually does know bull shit when he hears it!
Okay first, your face is not fat, your face shape is lovely, you've got a nice mouth that probably holds a wicked smile, and I dig the buddy holly glasses.  It hurts, and it should, that tpeople who should support you are cruel, but it is their failing not yours, and you choose your own destiny.
You look great, and I would be happy to have you as my kid.
There are few people in this world who truly pull off thick rimmed glasses without them looking like a tacky accessory - you are one of these people. They look true and so do you. You look true. That is a lot.
You look fly af, so no need to give a damn what your parents say!
Well I'm trans too and I think you look handsome! Don't listen to your parents, you look amazing.
You look fantastic. I love your hair color and your glasses look really nice on you.
I don’t know what your parents are talking about!  I’m a mom, so I will tell you what I would tell my children:  you have been a delight since the day you were born.  You are incredibly brave, and I’m proud to know you.  And you are perfectly lovely, however you identify yourself.  You are enough.  Let me know how I can help.
You look fantastic! You deserve to be the "you" you are most comfortable with! Keep at and time to find some support friends!
You look like quite a handsome fella.

I’m so sorry your parents are denying your validity. As for me, I believe I you, I know with certainty that you’re valid, and I love you unconditionally.

Sending love, comfort, encouragement, and hope.

Peace.
I'm so sorry for what you're going through.  I wish I could hug you.  You are a beautiful person.  You have value.  There is nothing wrong with you, and you are not disgusting, or fat faced.  Sometimes the family you make is more supportive and helpful than the one you're born with.   If you need someone to talk to, please DM me.  I'm always happy to have a new friends.  Life will get better, as you gain more independence.  Please reach out to local LGBTQ groups.  They will help you.
Wow, your parents are crazy. That's definitely not what you look like. You look like a cool dude with good taste in glasses.
You rock those frames, and you look super cool and fun to be around
I'm so sorry to hear about your parents!  Also, you are definitely not a disgusting fat-faced he-she, you look amazing and you're really really handsome ngl. you pass very very *very* well. don't listen to them. they're just being stupid. I'm here for you anytime if you need to talk, I hope you have an amazing day/night.  💚  💚  💚
Heck, I didn't even think you were trans until I saw your intro. I wish I passed as well as you, man.
You don't look bad. You look great. Fuck your parents.
I’m so sorry your parents aren’t supportive of you. You’re a beautiful person and I hope you find beautiful people in your life that will love and support you for who you are 💖
Hey friend! Sorry your parents kinda suck... just know that I support you! You’re valid! You’re strong! I know you’ve got this! If you ever need a friend please let me know! I’m always open to talk to if needed! You’re not disgusting or fat faced. You’re a handsome strong guy who’s fucking got this! Have a great week and keep your chin up :)
I have a trans son and am consistently amazed not just by him, but by the community as a whole. The raw fucking GUTS you show is absolutely inspirational. You are living an authentic life and being true to yourself, and that takes more balls than most people have that were born with them. I know I dont know you, but wish I did. I'm so fucking proud of you, and have no doubt you are an amazing young man, and I would so proud to have you as a son.

I am incredibly  sorry your parents cannot accept you for who are, and see the strong, fierce, amazing son they have. I know nothing could replace having parents that support you, but they sound like GIANT assholes, so ignore them and know there IS support out there for you, tons of it right here on reddit. 

If you ever need ANYTHING, please message me, even if you just need someone to talk to. ESPECIALLY  if you just need to to talk. 

Take card of yourself, and remember to hit me up, that offer is 100%.
Your parents are idiots and you are very handsome. Great eyebrows.
You remind me of my little brother! 

Your family sounds like they need to get over themselves and get their shit together. It's not about you, it's about them. You keep doing you, and make yourself happy as can be. It will get better. 

And remember, you will always have a family within the LGBT+ Community. <3

Good luck!
Okay, I just need to say that, first of all, the first things that I look at when I see the image of a person are their eyes, so my immediate thought was "wtf is Chris Evans doing on r/toastme?"

Don't let them get to you. <3

I imagine that they're having a hard time forgeting their daughter. Maybe it will just take some time for them to realize that you were and still are their son. I just can't rationalize how they could think any of those things about you when you are so handsome.
I didn’t know what was real until I got away from my parents. Turned out I was more right than I thought. You’re young, hot, and really brave. FUCK your parents. It makes me deeply angry that they’d choose any backwards belief over their goddamn child. Good for you for getting this far. You’re not alone. <3
You might have a baby face, but that only means that you’re going to age really well! You are super handsome and you look like a really nice person. Your parents might not be very supportive of you, but you can find lots of love and support from friends and found family.
Your parents are wrong. You look good. You have every right to be here and live your life. And no matter what you do, you are stronger than them.
You’re awesome as you are!  Be done with anyone who belittles you, no matter how difficult.  You deserve better!
Don’t listen to ur parents dude, u to pass real fuckin well. I love the color of ur hair in comparison to ur darker colored eyebrows too, it looks super cool. Pls remember that u can always choose who ur real family is : ) ur def a 10/10
Don't give them a chance by not engaging in those types of conversations with them. You look good and you have every right to be who you are. You'll settle into your yourself and realise what lies they were saying. You've had the courage to step up this far, you know you'll make it with or without their support.
You’re certainly handsome, and *definitely not* fat-faced! 

I’m sorry your parents are acting like that. We can be your online fam if you want. Have you eaten today? Taken your meds? Getting enough sleep?
As a twenty something trans guy, I am insanely jealous of how manly you look
You look like a beautiful, skinny-faced, he-she
I saw your profile pic and was kind of hoping you were a cute girl with a tom-boy haircut (or androgynous at the very least) -- so I'd say your folks are wrong.

10/10, would ask out on a date (and would love to see in a sundress)
Thank you! Been working on going no contact, and this might have been the final push.
In the moment, it’s hard to remember that, so thank you
Maybe they should borrow my glasses...? No, but, thank you
Much appreciated! My glasses are pretty much my favorite accessory
That’s the hopeful plan— to cut out those who would cut me down and all that. Thank you
Thank you! It’s true. That whole shared experience of risking safety for authenticity thing haha. There’s probably joke in there about fire forged friendships and flaming homosexuals but...
Always wanted to go to Pride, so the next one might just be my year. Thank you
Even though I posted on this sub I still got all flustered at the compliment. Thank you so much!
Thank you. Even if you don’t understand the exact same pressures faced, we’re both stigmatized and I appreciate the support
I didn’t realize I needed to hear that until I read it. Thank you, really and truly. It means a great deal to me, especially coming from a mother
We’re our own worst critics, mate, and thanks!
Haha thank you for your kind words! 

As for forgetting “her”... she’s been dead nearly 8 years, and for 4 years I’ve lived as male so. They’re gonna have to get used to it and I’m not going to keep my life on hold any longer.
I get to be the baby faced dude laughing at the old farts then? Good to know! 

Thank you for the kind words
Working on it every day, and these comments all helped!
Working on cutting ties, because you’re right :)
It’s the small things, like you saying I pass. Thank you!
I plan on cutting them out as soon as possible so they can’t drag me down further. Thank you
Thanks mate! That means a lot

Now go sleep!
19 is a tough age. All the shit you're going through now is just a learning curve - take all the knowledge you can from it and trust that things will get better. You'll be fine x

PS: I love your hair!
You have beautiful features! Giant eyes and full lips? Very pretty. Also, at 19 i struggled as well. All the way til u was about 22. And life got so much better. Pick up a hobby just for the joy of it to infuse your life with a little happiness.
You're perfect. 
Stop trying to figure out who you are supposed to be and decide who you want to be.  Write down your moral values.  Your goals.  What makes you happy
And if it's not on that list. Fuck it.
You are very very pretty and those eyes 😍😍😍
People pay cash money for cheekbones like that, and your skin could be the ‘after’ in a proactiv commercial. You actually make multicolored hair look cute also!
Aw baby, you look so cute. Trust me, you'll be fine eventually. Life sucks when you're 19.
I'm so overwhelmed by these comments. Thank you all so much, I really do feel much better. I don't know what else I can say other than I'm so happy that there are so many positive people who care about making others happy. I hope everyone who upvoted or commented has a great day, just know that you've made someone else's!!
Don't hate how you look, your hair is great! And you have a sweet face. 

I'm not sure if anybody really knows where they're going, especially at 19. If they say they do they're either lying, crazy or very very driven by some desire. Most of us just see what happens, make decisions as they come to us and basically just wing it. I'm still winging it 20+ years on, but I do remember it was something that worried me a lot in my mid teens and it used to keep me awake at night. Things worked out though, and I'm sure they will for you.
When I was 19, I was in an abusive relationship. I was always self conscious about my weight. I worked a dead end job at McDonald's, and I failed out of college for my dream job (software engineering). Now I'm 23, single and taking the time to find myself, getting in shape, and making more money as a CNC machinist than I ever thought I would.

Life changes in the blink of an eye. It's okay if you don't know who you are or what you want to do. You are still young. As am I. We have time to figure things out. Who we are now is likely not who we will be a few years from now. Keep your chin up and look forward, even if the path is hazy and unclear. You've got this.
Damn girl you are beautiful! Your eyes are just gorgeous! Please don’t feel sad, if you want to talk about what’s bothering you, please dm me.
you’re cute as actual fuck though- clear skin, lovely kind eyes, full lips and biiiiitch i’m so jealous of your hair. 
Teenage years are shit, but sometimes u just gotta get real stoned, look in a mirror and see that you don’t look anything like the adolescent self about which you grew to be so insecure. You’re blooming, flourishing. It’s ok not to have a plan, either - just a bit of faith in the universe that you’ll end up somewhere you’re happy. you got this!! 💙💖
19 is a rough transitional age, I promise things will turn up soon! You have the most magical unicorn hair and lips people pay tons of money for!
You have beautiful, kind eyes! I’m gonna let you in on a little secret... hardly anyone knows where they’re going at age 19. You have plenty of time to explore options!
At the risk of sounding like a serial killer: you have beautiful skin
If it makes you feel better, I had no idea what I was doing when I was 19 either. I think it’s a common feeling. But it worked itself out, and I have a feeling it will for you too :)

P.s you have gorgeous lips! The kind people wish they could pay a lot of money for. You’d be a great lipstick model. I can tell you have an amazing sense of individual style and I admire you for that.
You are gorgeous. Your hair is magical and your eyes are really lovely!
As for where you're going in life, you're gonna figure it out. It'll just take a little time.
Don't let negative thoughts ruin your self esteem. You are a beautiful person and I hope one day you can see that.
Love your hair and your eyes
You are beautiful! Sweet eyes and a mouth women would kill for. You are young - just go one step at a time, one day at a time, etc. Plans will fall into place and you will find a more clear path as you get older. Just avoid toxic people, skeezy salesman, and too much self-doubt. When I feel like its all crap and I can't do it anymore, I am usually just tired and need a nap. Yes, like toddler, and I am nearing 40.
You really slayed it with your hair! Normally I wouldn't think that those colors would go together well, but you make it look so good! Keep your chin up, because for whatever reason you are down there's a way that it will go back up. Just keep smiling and touching people's lives!
As someone who is also trying to figure their life out, I feel you. I wish the best of luck on finding peace and happiness, sis :)
The world is massive. This is the first thing to know. On average a human speaks 870 million words in their lifetime. There are roughly 7.8 Billion people on this planet. Thinking about this in my life has been a freeing experience. It’s allowed me to not be so attached to the ideals and standards of the environment I was raised by. This planet is so much bigger than we can even really comprehend. If you dedicated one word to every human you could in your life, you wouldn’t be able to hit 1/7 of the current population. That’s not even considering new people that will be created in your lifetime.

What this means to me is, whoever you are, wherever you are, you are exactly you. No better or worse. But always changing. Our bodies on average replace every cell over the course of about 7 years (from what I’ve heard). You are becoming something more every day. That is the human experience, we are in a constant bloom. We never really are anything, we are becoming anything we want. 

So to you I would say this. 

You are a beautiful blossom that is just beginning to become something else. I don’t know what it is and that means there is limitless potential in you, you can control the direction you go to a certain degree if you are aware. Keep in mind however that the forces of your environment will always play a role in how you change too. To that end, the world is so large that I’m sure there are people out there who are going to be your family and community if you look for them. Keep moving and experience this vastness with an open heart and kindness. You will find great places. You are not confined to the world you see. Good luck:)
You look like a dolly version of Billie Eillish
Your a Cute huggable person
It's okay! It's okay to not know who you are or where you're going. It's okay to cry, to scream. That means you're *alive.* I promise you, you're not alone. When you start to put the pieces of you together, when you start feeling better, you'll know it was all worth it.

Sometimes we fall apart to shape into a different portrait. You got this. Keep pushing, you're beautiful and most of all, you're *worth it.*
You look amazing! Don't let shit get you down.
you look great, don't sell yourself short.

Anyone who collects CD's like you do is a friend of mine! I'd like to hear what some of your favorite bands are.
You probably wont have a sense of self until 30, so quit trying and enjoy the ride. All of your experiences over the next few years will determine who you are ! Best of Luck!
You have such kind eyes and I love your hair girl! Keep that chin up, things will get better for you <3
Very few people at 19 know where they’re going.  
You’re young, you’re cute, smile and live your life at your best.  
Things will eventually all come at their place.  
Cheers.
You're nice.
You are so naturally beautiful that it makes you more beautiful you cannot see it. 

Great eyes...hair...lips...shape of face...you are adorable. 💖
Honestly, I’m in a pretty rough patch too. The important thing is to focus on what you can do about it, and do things that make you happy. Also I absolutely love your hair!
I understand how incredibly frustrating it might be to feel lost in where you’re going in life, but you are still so young with so much future ahead of you. Take every day as it comes. You deserve to have some peace of mind.
You are stunning! Those eyes are gorgeous, and I love how you dyed your hair. It’s very cool!
Girl I’m 33 with a husband and a kid and still have no idea what I’m doing with my life! You have so so much time to figure it out. There’s no rush! You’re beautiful. Self love is hard but start looking for one thing you like about yourself each day!! You look fun and artsy!!
I absolutely adore the hair color & you have beautiful eyes as well!
I guess you have the perfect baby face. OMG , you are so adorable feminine baby faced.
You’re beautiful with cool hair! Tip to you, 18-25 years old is a weird time and don’t compare yourself to others your age.
If you knew where you were going at 19 I'd think you were crazy. Relax a minute and enjoy before you really have to be an adult. If you really do have to button down and do everything,  take it slow. The more stressed you are the more you'll mess up. Chin up gal, you can make it through
I don't know you but i know you're perfect the way you're and don't let anyone tell you otherwise <3
It’s ok to not know who you are that’s perfectly fine. Everyone gets Down and clueless I love your hair and your eyes are so pretty.
I love your hair. Also, you're really cute. You don't need to know what you're doing. I'm the same age, and I have no clue what the hell I'm doing with my life. Here's some support, and an internet hug. I'm here if you need anything.
i’m also 19f and i totally understand your struggles. we’re at the point where some people expect us to have our lives together and others treat us like children. 

you are beautiful and i love your hair! i have full confidence you will find the path that is right for you.
Your eyes are more stunning than a taser set on high.
Wowow you are beautiful!
This is temporary. You are at a rough age. Not really a kid anymore but not quite an adult either. You will be ok. And don't worry about your looks. You are really cute! I love your hair too. You will be fine. Don't worry.
Username absolutely doesn’t check out.
Your face is so soft, very beautiful. You also have really cool hair, I love the two-toned thing. Keep your head up, you’re a lovely woman and even though I cannot help you through this difficult time, I just hope you can find strength in yourself to do so
You are so beautiful and I love your hair! You are still so young, you don’t need to have everything figured out just yet, all you have to do is keep going without giving up. Everything will work out in the end, you are right where you’re meant to be right now.
I'm 18 right now, and believe me, I get it. Being between 17 and 21 are considered by many to be some of the hardest years as an adult. It'll get better, at least in my experience, that's how it works.

Your hair is really well-styled and organized, it's got a cool cotton candy (or candyfloss, depending on where you live) look going for it!
I'm 31 and I still don't know where I am going in life. Don't worry, we all feel that way.
Oh god your hair! It's amazing!

&#x200B;

Life kinda sorts itself out, just enjoy the ride!
Im pretty sure youre blind, because you look amazing
At that age I didn't know where I was going in life either. Don't beat yourself up over that. You will figure it out (putting yourself out here gives me some confidence to say that).

I do like your eyes, they have a very sincere look.
I hope things change for the better. We're not put on this Earth to just pay bills and die. Do what you can when you can and when you can do better, do better. Just one day at a time. I will raise my glass in knowing that better days lie ahead. Cheers!
Funky hair!! You’ll find your path just keep being a good person!
Yeah, 19 is def an age that sucks to go through but I'll be honest... You're awesome, your hair is awesome (I wish I can do the same actually).
You have such a kind face. I feel like being in your presence would be very calming.
You have gorgeous features and you look sweet and innocent
Your hair identifies u as an individual
Whats the best part of your body?
I remember thinking I was supposed to have it all figured out by 19. After all, you’re an adult at 18 right? Don’t worry, you actually have lots of time to work everything out! Most of my friends are still getting our shit together in our 30s. It’s okay. Life isn’t a race. 

And as far as how you look, I think you’re so cute. You have such amazing eyes!
I LOVE your hair! Everything about it <3
r/DemEyesDoe 😍
How could you hate the way you look when you have such big, beautiful eyes and perfectly pink, plump lips! You have a nice light about you. Whenever I feel down about the way I look I remember those moments when I looked in the mirror and though "DAMN, you look GOOD today!" Because we all have those moments when we're feelin' ourselves! Try to conjure those feelings when you're feeling low. I know it's difficult but you can do it! Fight for the good moments, you have more control over them than you think.
You’ve got a perfect “doll face” - that’s not something you should hate.
I like the color choices in ur hair
your eyes are so pretty and you look so kind!
Love your hair and you're so pretty ! i believe in you and you'll be able to figure stuff out when time comes. no one really knows what their doing tbh
Try not to be so hard on yourself. You’re 19, it’s okay to not have everything figured out. I’m 28 and I still second-guess myself plenty. Like anything else, confidence is a learned habit. Basically, fake it til you make it. Trust me, it works. Eventually, confidence becomes second nature. But don’t think that doubt ever fully goes away. You always have to take the bad with the good and vice versa. Again, you’re young so enjoy being young! Do what makes you happy and don’t listen to criticisms from whomever you would not take advice.
You look lovely. Please remember that no matter what happens, or how hard it gets, things will always end up the way they’re supposed to. There will come a time when you look back and realize everything was worth it, and I hope for nothing but happy days in your future.
I like your hair colours it really suits you
Of course you don’t know where you’re going in life, you’re 19! Who you are is also still being established. Being a teenager sucks frankly, but being in your 20s is so much better! I’ve been where you are, I didn’t like my teenage years and hated how I looked. But as a adult everything changed, my looks settled in so I do look better but I also don’t think the way I did as a teenager. Your hormones will calm down and you won’t have such strong feelings of despair I promise! Be kind to you.
I love your hair. The highlights, especially in the blue are fantastic.  Your skin looks so healthy, too. You don’t need to know where you’re going in life; most of us don’t. Getting hung up on thinking that there’s somewhere you need to be headed can really drag you down and distract you from the things that can bring you joy in the present. Try to find something good in this moment and just have faith that doing little things that make you happy right now will pave the way to a positive future. It sounds silly but if you force yourself to smile, it convinces your brain that you’re feeling good... and you keep feeling good for some time. Try it. Give it, like, 30 seconds.  You’ll feel like a dork but it’s one of those small things you can do right now to make a brighter later... and you deserve that!
I wish I had your eyes- They blend in so perfectly with your hair, you are absolutely gorgeous! 

Hang in there- Life has it's rough moments, however I believe in your ability to overcome them and have a fulfilling life. Start by having the best day ever today that you can- Do things you love, talk to the people who make you happy, and don't forget that being who you are is the most important part of finding self confidence and joy.
You have an incredible palate of features to play with. Makeup? No makeup? Blue hair? Pink? Brown? Auburn? I see no end to what fun you can have. Perhaps that’s why you haven’t figured out who you are. Many ppl are pigeon holed into one look. Wow. You can play with so many and still be the same cool creature that sits deep behind the controls. 
19 is a good age to play like that. (I’m 66 and ppl think I’m nuts). But so many decades to come to hone in on what finally suits your fancy. I’m kind geeked for you!
I love your hair! You will figure it out- 19 is the age for learning who you are and what you want.  Hang in there!
I hope your username doesn't mean you're calling yourself a terrible accident because you're not. I like your hair, it's awesome! I also like your eyes. They're pretty and honest and kind. You'll figure things out eventually. My dad always told me to try not to worry about anything because things always have a way of working themselves out the way they're supposed to be and I have found that to be true. If you do hugs then hugs.
Praying for you.  I love your hair.
Your hair is badass!
First off, you’ve got gorgeous eyes. And I love the dual color hair. You’re a pretty woman. 

You’re 19; you’re still becoming who you will be. So don’t sweat the lack of direction. It will come. Keep exploring the world. Try new things. Try your best not to withdraw from the world. Some of the greatest in their field didn’t start in that direction until much later in life. 

You’re going to get this sorted out because you’re smart. You came here looking for a boost and that’s a smart move. 

You’ve got this. There’s a great future ahead.
 Listen as someone who has and still is struggling with my self image I can say it gets better just do you and be yourself if you like a certain fashion style wear it and do t listen to the haters there just jealous btw love love love the hair!!!
This might sound random as far as physical compliments go but I think you have the cutest nose and lips — like, I would kill for those features as a girl myself
Sorry to hear you're having a hard time of it. You've got a pretty face, incredible lips and gorgeous eyes. Oh, and your hair rocks too :)
Cool hair!
People can always find an easy way to talk smack about someone who expresses themselves and looks different you've done nothing wrong will p.m. you
It’s totally okay to not know what you want to do. Try lots of things, think about your hobbies and what you enjoy. 

Like I enjoy aquascaping, equestrian sports and art. So in school I majored in equestrian studies and animation. 

It took me a long time to choose between horses and art as a career but I eventually figured it out and work at a game studio I love!!! 

Basically, find what you’re passionate about and chase it- you’re gonna so great!
Hey. You’re okay! I remember when I was 19. I didn’t even knew what to eat on breakfast, let alone figure out my life. But I’m 29 and things are fine. I learnt a lot and managed to get many experiences. Trust your instincts and educate yourself and you’ll be fine. 

You’re also very beautiful, blue eyes, white clean skin and full lips, I have friends who pay good money to look like you. 

You’re fine the way you are and you’ll be fine. Trust yourself.
Hey, you’re 19. You probably just got out of high school, maybe just recently started college. You’ve just gotten out of the tutorial of your life, and now you’ve taken the first step on your journey. Maybe you’ve slipped and fallen, maybe you scraped your knee a little; that’s okay, it happens. Stand back up, a little wiser, a little tougher, brush yourself off, and get moving. Sure, life sucks sometimes. But you can do anything you want to, so long as you don’t quit. You’re at the beginning of a beautiful life full of wonderful things, and even if you can’t see it now, you will go do great things. Take a deep breath, think as clearly as you can, and get moving, you beautiful human being you
Girl, those lips are to die for!  Love the hair as well!
Beautiful eyes! 🤩
I think you're realllly cute
18-22 is a really tough time, you're still getting to know who you are, and I know you might not like who you are now, but I'm sure there's a lot of people whom you matter to, and if not, there's a lot of people that would be only made better from knowing you. I don't see anything wrong with how you look, your hair looks nice, and you have pretty eyes. That being said, while I think you look lovely, a make-over might make you feel better about yourself and raise your self esteem. There's nothing wrong with changing how you look to be the best version of yourself that you can be.

&#x200B;

Never feel you have to change how you look to please someone else, change how you look because it will make you feel better. I know you'll get past all of this, so just stay strong and love yourself for who you are, and have a great day.
I’m not sure if it helps, but I’m around the same age, I’m just as lost...I think most people are. For the longest time I looked at some of my friends and said “How the hell do they have their shit together” turns out they all thought I had my shit most together...so we’re all pretty lost. You also have plenty of time to figure it out. To grow and change and to enjoy life.
You’re beautiful. You’re like a fusion between Sephiroth and a rainbow, which are two things I love. Enjoy your Day.
Your only 19... You have a long way to go and a lot of time to figure everything out. This is just the beggining! Also you have reeeealllyy nice eyes😍
I wish I had your boldness when I was your age! 19 is a tough year, tbh a tough season, because you're starting out, you're still shaping you're identity and you have everywhere to go!! It's really shitty, but these difficulties build you and the keys are to surround yourself with good people (find your people!), be kind to yourself :) You're incredible, just like your hair, so continue to be bold, experience new things and take a stand when you can. Xo
You have incredible lips and i hope you feel better!
Hey sometimes stuff happens and it seems all consuming. Keep things in perspective and reflect if this is something you can look back on and laugh. Just remember it’s either a good story to tell or a good lesson learned. You’re beautiful and have super awesome hair and eyes. You rule and are a wonderful incident the world is happy to have
Your eyes are absolutely beautiful and you have lips that some people would spend thousands trying to get
You have gorgeous, clear skin!
Firstly, you are the most kind and soothing person ever (this is your friend kayla btw).

You have a ridiculously cute face and cute image to match; you have a warm soul and a warm way; you have impeccable taste; above all you simply dont deserve the hardships you've been dealt, and that's a fact.

If you keep treating people the way you do right now, the way you treat me and others we know, you will see light soon, you must, or karma is bunk and i'll eat my hat. I'll eat your hat. I'll eat any hat I'm given. Anyone reading this in the future: if things end up poorly for this angel of a human here, feel free to PM me, I'll give you my address and you can mail me as many hats as you like I'll eat em. I'll eat those hats.

Love you darling ❤️
You have an incredibly kind looking face and just look like you are a sweetheart. Being 19 is rough but you got this girl!
You have really kind eyes
19 is tough. I had no idea where I was going in life. At 33 (34 in 2 weeks) I’m honestly still not sure. If you don’t like who you are, change it. Start doing little things to become the kind of person you want to be. 

You are so beautiful and we are all routing for you!
You rock!😊
Don't push it your young. Enjoy life while you can remember nobody is guaranteed another day
I think you look like a Disney princess.  You have one of the most naturally beautiful faces I've ever seen. Wow.
i love ur hair and ur eyes!!
You have the prettiest eyes and full lips that people would pay loads of money to have! Not to mention you have the coolest hair I’ve seen on anyone ever. It may not seem like it but things will get better I promise!
Your a young attractive lady, don’t let the past dictate your future. It appears you have a strong music collection behind you... music has gotten me through very harsh times in my life, wether it being Last Days of Humanity or KMFDM to Stravinsky. Cheers to your future endeavors!
I love your hair!
You have such kind eyes. Someday everything that you have endured will help you change people for the better. I'd be you already have, you just don't know it.
Don’t worry, there are lots of people older than you that *still* don’t know where they’re going in life. You’re self aware enough, you’ll be fine 💙

Also, I think you’re super pretty, and love your hair!
I can see that you toast others as well. You know what that makes you? A damn great person. You put in an effort to brighten the day of complete strangers. That is beautiful! You are truly wonderful, and please remember that! 

And it's so great to see that you feel better!
You are so young and have so many chances ahead of you to decide what kind of person you will be and to work for the kind of life you want. Start with achievable goals but always dream bigger.
This is a really sweet sub and I am happy that it exists.  I don't know how to make you feel better about anything except to tell you that because of you I now know this sub exists and I feel just a little bit better about this crazy world.  Good luck to you!
There’s just something about your eyebrows that I love. You look like an honest and good person who happens to be beautiful too. I feel like you could pull off so many looks - and look great in them all. Hair colors, makeup or not, clothing types, you are an awesome canvas. Probably an awkward comment but I promise I mean it in the best way, I wish I had that quality. The world is open to you.
Teenagers have it rough.  I teach HS and about half my classes have anxiety, depression and other issues.

You are lovely and obviously are sensitive.  Time will give you more answers.  You are starting to get to the age where you can shape your life like you want it.  But it is a process...don't rush it.
You are rocking the hair color! Wear it with confidence because you can work it!
Love your hair!!!
I love your hair!!!!
You look like your bound for happiness, take it one day at a time
Hang in there, babe. IT GETS SO MUCH BETTER.
19 is such a hard time.  We all go through it and I can relate.  You have so much ahead of you.  You're beautiful.  You have the cutest lips and nose and I love your hair.  I know what it's like to struggle with being kind to yourself.  I still struggle with it.  Just remember that you have value.  You're beautiful.  You have such kind eyes.  You matter.  You'll have good days, and bad days, but be kind to yourself and you'll have more good than bad.
Your lips are so plump and gorgeous and your eyebrows are the perfect shape. I can tell by your eyes that you are one of the good ones. Keep your chin up, do some form of physical activity to keep your mental health strong and the anxiety away, and talk to yourself in the mirror about your accomplishments and things you love about yourself. You can do anything you put your mind to❤️
You have the face of an angel.
You're very pretty, I really like your eyes and lips
If you are a well- educated, outgoing, polite, inquisitive person with plenty of internal drive & curiosity about your future, you should be learning continuously for all of your life.  Try to sample as much of life as you can spare, only way to gain experience that you may need later and be glad you did try something you maybe didn't think you could do.  Best of luck to you and also love those follicles emanating from you.
I wish I was as brave as you ROCKING that hair dye! I've never been brave enough to dye my hair.

You're doing great and you're enough! Just dream about where you'll be in another 19 years
You look like someone who'd be Billie Elish's younger sister 🙂
I think the fewest people really know where they want to go in their lives. Believe me, I for sure do not. And I think you are super cute! You have beautiful eyes!
You. Are. Gorgeous!
Sending much love and warmth and good energy your way 💕 you’re doing a great job and you’re going to do great things
Coming from a guy, I gotta say, you’re cute! :)
Honey your hair is beautiful.   It has a perfect part. The color is even.  And you can tell you washed it.  Your face is so cute.  I love your eyes and lips especially and I don’t even think you’re wearing makeup.
I love your hair. I’ve tried to do the two color thing and I just can’t seem to make it work, but you make it look awesome!
I love your hair
i kinda feel like everyone struggels at 19. I mean you just graduated highschool, your friends are leaving you, you're starting realize that in a year you will no longer be a teenager and now will become an adult. Its a huge stage in your life so don't expect to be easy. All I can say is to keep your head up high and keep moving forward. Find your passion and dreams in life and go for it. Don't second guess yourself and don't sell yourself out. Your life isn't over, its just beginning.
For starters, there are a lot of people who have no idea where they are going in life at 19 (I am 25 and still finding my path, and I know others older than me still finding their way). Second, your eyes are gorgeous and the shape of your lips is flawless. You are gorgeous and (although I know it is much easier to say than to feel) you shouldn't hate how you look. You are truly beautiful.

I hope your upcoming week is full of happiness and i hope you find some time to love yourself, because you deserve it! 19 is a hard time for many of us, it's a time of crazy transition and self-doubt but life keeps moving forward and if you give yourself some time you can find your footing in this world. Just remember you're not alone!
These next few years are going to change and evolve so fast, try to remember that whatever you’re feeling is always only temporary unless to fight time and try to hold on to the bad rather than seeking the good. I wish that someone had told me when I was 19 to look at my pst friendships and relationships, pick the best ones, and use those as a template. And also, don’t forget about family. I feel like I took them for granted during those days, and now I’m just trying to make up for lost time. ::hugs:: you got this, never forget that the only world that matters is the one you see. But make it a good one
19? You got a lot of time to do whatever you want. And there isnt anything wrong with how you look.
Girl, your eyebrows, lips, eyes, nose... literally everything’s perfect.
I remember 19 being tough as hell. When I was 19 I had no idea what I was doing or going either, but safe to say I eventually found my path. It took three major changes and three moves across the US. You'll find your path eventually, and it might take some tough stuff, but it WILL get better c: especially with your dope hair and absolutely huge eyes that I am super jealous of. Hang in there!
Secret: No one, not one single fucking person on this planet, actually knows what we’re doing. Anyone who tells you otherwise is oblivious or a liar (though not always malicious). Embrace it. Take a deep breath and shine.
Not to sound weird, but you have beautiful lips! 
I have typical white people lips, I would love to have bigger luscious ones! Yours are so cute!
Your hair is a perfect metaphor for life. On one hand, it's full of pain, loss, sorrow and rage. But on the other hand, it's calm, peaceful and fun! 19 is a difficult age area to go through (ik because I'm a 19M w/ autism). And you seem like the type of person who is quiet and shy in class, but when you start to know them as a person, you find out that they are a fun and awesome person!
You're 19. The vast majority of us had no idea where we were going in life at that age. Hell I still didn't really until my late 20s. Everyone does it their own way. Relax.
You have beautiful eyes, and your lips could sell lipstick!! And IMO it's pretty typical for a 19 year old to not know where she is going in life.
You look really cute to be honest :)
You genuinely look cute, and I'm not saying that just because you want to be cheered up. Most people dislike how they look but take it from a stranger: you have nothing to worry about.

And hey, you,'re 19, you have a whole life ahead of you.
Heya girl! I’m 19 too, just a gal tryin’ to make it through life. I don’t have any good advice or stuff, but I can cheer you on! Your hair is really really cute and you’ve got pretty eyes! You’ll figure stuff out! I think I know how you feel, kinda aimless and lost. But you can get through it! We both can! I’m rooting for you, and I’ll do my best too. You’re tough, you’re strong, and you’ve gotten this far! 19 years is a bunch! Almost two whole decades of just surviving. So keep on fighting and kickin’ life’s ass!!
I love the contrast between your eyes and hair. If life is easy then you are not trying hard enough. I think that you are trying hard and you are doing fine.
You look like a beautiful angel, and I love your hair. My son is 19, too, and it’s totally fine not to know where you are going in life yet. You might not know for a long time. 

It’s hard to do, and easy to say, but try not to worry too much about things like this. If you spend all your time worrying, you are missing the beauty and fun times around you. 

Hugs from an internet mom.
Man being a teenager sucks. Everyone makes you feel like you should have your whole life planned out. The crappy thing is that at 19 years old, you are facing a lot of firsts without a lot of guidance tailored to who you are and what you want. EVERYONE goes through this, whether they admit it or not. Everyone wants to fit in somewhere, everyone wants to feel like they aren't lost. However at 19, most kids have the "fake it till you make it" attitude or they act like they don't care. Its all a lie. 

Here are 3 Truths to get you through this time:

1) Everything you are facing is a temporary problem. I don't mean that it isn't important or its not a big deal, i mean that it will pass, and you will survive.

&#x200B;

2) You have a future and it is important, whether you see it or not. Everyone impacts other people. We all have the opportunity to help other people and who knows, you might be the reason someone else is alive.

&#x200B;

3) There is a God and he loves you right where you are and exactly how you are. He doesn't need you to be perfect, he just wants you to be you. 

&#x200B;

Hope this helps you!
How are you feeling today?  Any better?
You have big beautiful eyes and really fun hair! I hope that today is a better day for you
Your lips are really nicely shaped
No lie you have some of the most beautiful lips and a gorgeous pair of eyes and nose to match. You are beautiful without a doubt. Whatever it is I hate about myself I try to be kind and give myself time to work on it. I beat BAD social anxiety by making small changes over about two years. I know you can be someone you want to be too, self acceptance takes time for a lot of us. Life is crazy.. Message me if you ever want someone to talk to :)
The hair is to die for, your lips are pillowy and pretty, I love your cherub face. You are a doll!!! ❤ ❤ ❤
You have such a gentle face, you look like someone I could really let all of my feelings too. Someone I could really trust. And your shirt is hella nice
I sincerely hope that the kind words you receive here help in some way! Being a 19 year old girl is really tough, I’ve been there lol, I’m 30 now and things just get better as you get older, it becomes so much easier to just be casually confident. You’re super cute, but if you don’t like the way you look, you can change that! Don’t think that changing your appearance is a slight to your personality or something. I spent sooo many years of my teens/early 20’s straight up neglecting my appearance because I didn’t want to be one of “those girls” who cared about her appearance that much. Well, surprise, turns out when you do things that make you appear better, it will make you feel better! I wish I learned sooner that sometimes you just need to kind of change everything to make things easier on you. It’s not a betrayal to who you are at all. Personality shouldn’t ever be based on appearance. Ugh sorry for the rant but honestly girl I think you’re beautiful and a little lost and that’s okay, just try and remember that things will get better!
19 is so hard. You'll find your way. Chin up, love.  You're a beautiful young woman. I'm almost half your age, and I'm still trying to figure out where I'm going. ❤️
cheer up buttercup ur cute as hell and 19 aint an easy age I know. But you gotta remember the silver linings. even if it seems ridiculous or its hard to see at all. and im not talking about false optimism, im talking about trying to see what u can get out of every crappy situation to benefit u. it might be hard but its a good exercise nonetheless. good luck my love.
I just have to say that I love your hair! I don't even know how to describe it, but they are very nice colors. You have beautiful eyes and lips that I am jealous of haha. I love that you chose not to wear makeup for the picture, it looks very nice. You seem like a kind and absolutely beautiful person. Sorry so much of this was about looks, I hope that you are feeling a little better!
Listen you might not know it, but those eyes are killers. My dad told me eyes like that always snag the real ones, but first you have to open up your face. Pull your hair back, smile a lot, and try to draw attention to those beautiful orbs. Trust me, it is the best feature a parent can give.
It’s totally OK to not know where you’re going in life at age 19. Most people don’t. In fact, even those who think they *do* know usually end up in a 100% different place than they expected 10-20 years from
Now. You’ve got plenty of time. <3

Love your hair, by the way, and you legit have lovely facial features.
How can you hate yourself?!? You look beautiful!!!
Don’t worry, you’re gonna do great!

Source: I was 19 once and I turned out fine :)
Ur hair is SO cool! I love when people do 2 different colors! And ur eyes are amazing!
You’re adorable!
Whatever is happening, I know that you'll get through it and you will be okay. I hope things get better for you!
I'm in a similar situation, so please forgive me for kind of being a hypocrite, but you have to learn to love yourself. If you aren't happy with your look, play around with whatever you don't like. Whether it's makeup, clothes, etc. Have have fun with it (somewhat related though: I LOVE your hair color, I wish I could pull that off!). I don't know where I'm going in life either, but you're young and there is plenty of time to figure out what direction you want to take. Take some career quizzes and see what fits you best, if you aren't happy with those results research some careers that you find to be interesting. Or is there a hobby or yours that you could do something with? Look into that! It will take time, but you've got time and there is no rush. 
 
I hope you have a good week, and keep your head up!
19 year old me could not have possibly conceived of how awesome my life is today, nor how I achieved it

Take things a day at a time and congratulate yourself for the little things you do every day. 

You'll get there eventually. 

Hang in there! 

You also have the most striking eyes.
I'm 44 and have never had an idea what I want to be if I ever grow up.

I think that you are pretty, but remember that looks aren't what make people great. I get praised for working hard at my job, for solving difficult problems. At home I get praised for selflessly doing things for my wife, for loving her for who she is and not wanting her to be someone she isn't. I accept her completely, like I have to accept myself and love myself too.

You can love yourself too, but I can certainly understand how distant that can feel. It took me until moving out to my own place away from toxic family to be able to breathe and think about who I am. I hope you can do that too.

Some things to think about: do you like helping people? Are you competitive? Do you like being around people? Dealing with strangers? Do you deal well with conflict or do you do everything to avoid it? How do those things make you feel, and *why* do you feel those things? Remember that life wouldn't be interesting if we knew all the answers and all the spoilers!

You're still near the beginning of your life's journey. I think that you will do just great!

If you ever want to ask about stuff, PM me.
I spent my teenage years hating myself, brooding and thinking I was alone in life. Things get better. 

You seem like a person who has a lot to offer the world. And very cool hair. :)
I think you are really adorable and you hair is awesome :)
You have lovely eyes and your hair is very cool, just take one day at a time life can be tough but try to let the positive outshine the negative :)
Hey so just wanted to say that you seem like a very interesting person. You're probably really into music or something like that, and that's awesome! 

It can be hard to not think negatively about yourself - I'm still learning, I'm only 19 too. But you have a long, long life ahead of you. It's certainly not too late to ask for help. There's tons of places to go to get help deciding what you want to be, community colleges, libraries, or even online. But just keep at it, and you'll be happy that you did!

Sorry this probably isn't worded well, I'm pretty tired lol. Btw I love your hair, and you're also really pretty! Hope the best for you ☺
Take it a day at a time.
First: don't ask people to be kind. You deserve kindness and should walk away for anything less. Second: that hair looks like some awesome cotton candy. Sport that hair everywhere.
You look good
You have a beautiful face. Don't distract from it with coloured hair. I'm sure your natural colour is awesome too.
Ya'know. I'm going through some tough shit too. My former best friend just out and yeeted me out the window. But anyway, I love your hair and the general shape of your face.
Your hair is fantastic!!!! Secondly, 19 is rough. I made some of the stupidest mistakes at 19 but know what? I don’t regret them now. I am happy at 26 and wouldn’t be here had I changed anything in the past. You will get through. Also, don’t take anyone’s shit. Families, friends, no ones. Also, family is who you choose. Relatives are who you’re stuck with.
Awe you are an awesome lady with a beautiful face and just take some time for yourself and take care of yourself. Remember you can do great things.
You have insanely beautiful eyes!
The colors in your hair bring out the blue in your eyes, and you have lovely eyes! It's a great look on you.
Girl, you are so young.  And NONE of us know where we're going in life.  We might think we do, but I'm 31 and I have no clue where I'm going!

You're a beautiful girl with youth on your side.  Don't ever settle for something that you don't feel right about in your gut - not a man, not a job, not a home situation.  Always strive for better.

I'm not sure what you're going through, but I know things always seem horrible, but they have a way of working out.  Sending some good vibes your way!  ❤️
You're cute as heck!! Wooooow!!!!

And I love your hair. Not everybody can pull that off and it often looks stupid on people who try, but you ROCK that look!! I'd hit on you in a heart beat, and then you'd probably shoot me down LOL.

Feel free to PM me sometime if you ever need someone to chat with. I might be able to give you some cool life advice too, as I was once aimless and lost, not so long ago.
Same 19m here got serious anxiety about my past mistakes. How am I supposed to look forward to the future when i cant forget how much of a dickhead i was. 

Advice ppl give me is to learn to forgive myself. 

Good thing about anxiety is that now you know you, you can't make the same mistakes again. It gets better.
I think you look super sweet... If you feel like doing something that might help YOU to see yourself similarly, maybe try having your eyelashes tinted blue-black...it looks to me as though you have long beautiful lashes that aren't very dark at the ends (like me) It's the only beautifying thing I bother with myself (sometimes) because I'm much older than you and have the confidence in my appearance that I found became easier with age...

BELIEVE IT AND YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL! PS do you ever try parting your hair slightly to one side or the other? I reckon that'd look awesome with the complementary colours you got at the moment!

PPS your lip shape is one of the classics-your features are gorgeous chickie! 😊
I love your hair!
You are the cutest fucking thing ive ever seen. Wtf?
Your hair is amazing as you are
You don’t deserve what’s being thrown at you 
You have a lot to live for your family and friends if you don’t have neither you have your fav food your fav movie your fav etc keep it up you got this
I hope you are ok just be you...we are all different...not every one gets along ...everyone struggles learning who they are...this process takes time and I think you look superb also I love your eyes simply stunning
You look absolutely beautiful,  and dont worry about where you are headed, just enjoy the journey along the way... that's what it is all about... life is what you make!
First thing I will say... I love your hair... I actually had it the same a few years ago.

Second thing... I'm older than you and I have days where I feel like I am stuck,, but you will have days where it makes sense.

Thirdly and lastly... Don't hate how you look... Embrace it... You are a pretty thing and maybe you need to find a new style that makes you feel like you :).
Full lips and button nose, I’m jealous 😭😭😭
Why do you say you hate your looks? You have the prettiest face!

I like your hair too. You've got a cool vibe. You're the kind of person I'd like to hang out with.
1) you look great 2) no one at 19 knows where they are going in life :)

You're gonna be fine .
Most people don’t know where they are going in life. You are fine. As long as your trying to do better, your going in the right direction.
It might not get better today. It probably won't. Tomorrow might even be worse. But, IT GETS BETTER. You are valuable.
Hey there. I’m 25 and have no idea where I’m going in life!!! Don’t focus so much on your destination or what your purpose is, just try to enjoy your day to day life. I didn’t know what I wanted to do at your age (still don’t) so I just got an ordinary office job. It’s only the last few years I’ve started having specific interests and knowing what I might want to do. You have heaps of time to work it out. NO ONE knows what they want at your age, even if they think they do, it’s likely gonna change as they experience the world more.
Don’t put any pressure on yourself!
Also I’d pay to have your lips xx
Love your hair and you have a gorgeous face!
I love the cotton candy XXXtentacion hair color😎

I was just browsing Reddit for fun and I came across this comment. Even I'm 19 and I needed this comment. I'm gonna sleep peacefully now.
Other teenage redditors also needed to know this! Thankyou!
Great advice
Nicely said
I was thinking the same thing! Those eyes! Fabulous lips! Perfect skin. It will get better.
You’re super cute and have your whole life ahead of you to experience good and bad things. I hope you gain a positive outlook on the roller coaster of life, because we ride it anyway! Hold someone’s hand if you need to!
Some of the most wonderful, fun people don't still know what they're doing at age 40. I think the "figuring it out' turned out to be learning how to just "ride the ride of life". :)

Agree....beautiful eyes, face, and super kind with coming to toastme!
Seriously!  

Nineteen was probably the hardest year of my life, but it resulted in a lot of personal growth!
Let’s not devalue someone’s personal issues purely because of their age. Lets not devalue them at all. :)
This is not a toast. This is not r/advice. Please see the rules and post accordingly.
Trust me as a fellow teenager I can say with confidence. Life will throw you shit and it may suck but that doesn’t have to stop you from having fun. Feeling down - go do something you have fun doing. Don’t let others tell you what you should be doing sometimes you need to just listen to yourself.
Right? Ugh she’s beautiful.
Ayyy teenagers rise uppppp
Your smile is infectious!! Keep smiling:)
Your smile is fucking gorgeous.
That UFO patch is so cool! I want it haha. Have a great day!
You look like a really expensive stock image that would come up when you search "happiness teen rainbow" on Google
Very cute smile that inspires happiness!
awesome smile dude! i’m getting braces put on soon and i’m nervous that there going to look ridiculous on me, this definitely was a boost seeing how you rock them! :~)
You seem really confident! Nurture that part of yourself, it will serve you well.
Hope you had fun watching X-files. You look like you have lots of friends and they all think you are the best!
Aaaaah I love your hair! It’s like perfectly tousled. Also nice wrist candy.
Your smile makes me smile. I'm imagining that you have the same energy irl.
To the scene kid! Seeing you this happy as you are now makes me hopeful for the future when you're the ones in charge of things. (That day can't come fast enough.) Stay awesome.
youre such a beautiful creature !!!!! you look so friendly and kind. keep smiling :)
The way you express yourself is inspiring. I love the colors!
Your smile is so amazing and genuine, don’t ever lose that pure happiness. Right away you just seem like such a kind soul. Your colorful bracelets are awesome! I use to stack bracelets like that on my arms, but they were the rubber ones that said “Livestrong” and things like that, if you know what I’m talking about. I completely forgot about doing that until I saw your picture, and I got that warm/fuzzy nostalgia feel. Don’t let the world ever keep you down, because we need more sunshine like the kind you bring. <3
YOU ARE SO CUTE! And you got a really cool sense of style too, you're awesome!
You’re so cute
Hey buddy. Sending you as much love, happiness, and encouragement to get you through the next week.

I gotta say that based on your picture, you seem like a great guy to be around. Also, your furry character designs are pretty sweet. (It’s not my scene, but I have to say that they are objectively cool)

Take it easy friend. 

Cheers.
I love your UFO patch! and dont think I didnt see the alien sticker thingy either. Any chance I will be seeing you this september in Area 51?

&#x200B;

your smile is contagious, keep smiling. I love your UWU, furry and minecraft bracelets. minecraft is pretty fun ngl.
u have such a cute smile and i like how ur eyes do that thing while ur smiling aw
Buddy you made me smile!! You are amazing!
This is the happiest photo I've seen today :D You keep being you kid, and of course keep being awesome! <3 xx
Haven't seen a genuine looking smile like this in a while.
Looks great!
the jewelry takes me back. I wish I had pictures of me from my teens when I was doing the same thing LOL this actually made me smile a lot thank you
:DDD!! thank u!!!!
\>_< 
 An UwU has been identified! That makes 2358 UwUs in the last 27 days! 
 ^(Blep. Blop. I am a bot!)
I would also like instructions on how you get your hair like that. 
Please and thanks.
bedhead and a quick but hard shake of my head!! hahah
3 years??? You don’t look old enough for all that. Don’t waste time dwelling on the ones who hurt you. But never forget the bastard name
Take that rotten toast and throw it in the trash, and start over with a happy, friendly, positive one. Have a great day, I hope you get rid of all the bad Karma in your life.
Honestly, if you’re looking for a new partner, half of Reddit has got you beautiful. Stay strong <3
You are beautiful! Look beyond these things to see that so much good is coming in your life.
time heals all wounds. if your partner was asshole enough to end 3 years in 3 minutes over the phone, you deserves better all along anyways!!

you’re young and got your whole life ahead of you, take time to heal, allow yourself to be sad and process what has happened, no shame in that :) and when you’re ready be selfish for a while, do what makes YOU happy! it’s hard to stay in touch with yourself in such a serious relationship at a young age, you have the opportunity to really get to know and love yourself now, without having to worry how it will affect your partner :)
Oh, I'm so sorry. That must really be tough. The sleep deprivation doesn't help either but I'm sure no one realizes this like you. Try to get some electrolytes into your system. You're probably a bit dehydrated as well.

Yeah, just to reiterate what's already been said: don't waste your time with that loser. Real people don't break up via phonecalls. Go get yourself someone real. Have high standards. Nobody ends a relationship like that with a phonecall. You deserve better than that. But you've made this is far, and you're still standing! Here's to you! Strong, independent, and obviously out of most men's league! Take your time to heal but never forget that you deserve to have high standards. Cheers to you!
You look like Thora Birch in Ghost World. I love Ghost World, I love Thora Birch. Your eyes are sad, but your smile sincere and kind. You're a fine person.
The fact that you already at least try to smile keeps me positive, that you will get through this. You got this.
 That’s a shitty thing for your ex to have done. You deserve better.
Thought I'd do this cause it would cheer you up, but this boy of yours, was he ever really good enough? But you have to know that you are tough, you have a life without him, and I hope that's good enough, but you needed a toast, that thing he said, was a total dose, but the mind can wander, the mind's fucking gross, it makes you worry, it makes you see close, but you need to see, the world without him and you, it has made you really blue, but you can make it through, like all strong minds do.
Without knowing what was said in the phone call at least he respected you enough to actually make a call and not just text. Im sure you will find someone again when the time is right. You managed to be with someone for 3 years so their is obviously alot of good things about you when so many relationships these days barely make it past 1 month.
Just try to see the next person for who he is and not for the person that you just ended with
A very genuine smile you got. Carry it as much as you can :)
You didn't deserve that. You will get through this! I believe in you <3
You look lovely and so does that artwork behind you, you have good taste. It will get easier.
You deserve so much better. Don't let them keep you crying, they deserve no more tears from you. Try devoting the next few weeks to be about you as much as you can, do things that make you happy, and forget about that person. You are young and you will find love again if you want, or you can be perfectly content and happy alone and doing things for yourself. People put a real stigma on being alone, but I think we can be just as fulfilled living for ourselves and by ourselves, but if it helps, you can also put your love into pets.
Everything happens for a reason and for the best.  Try reading or listening to this book:  101 questions to ask before you get engaged.  And it all will start making sense to you.
Hey girl you are now on the low and i still think you are very cute! Imagine on the best day you will be radiantly beautifull.
Breakups are hard, but time heals all wounds. Allow yourself to be sad for now. Wallow in it for a few days. And then pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and focus on the things in your life that make you happy. You look strong, you can get through this.
When I dealt with one of my harder break ups, someone gave me the advice to take the time to focus on self improvement and I found that really helped. You might find yourself with extra time now that you could spend doing some things you have wanted to do but didn’t have an opportunity to start. It will help to keep your focus off the relationship and to regain your confidence, if it’s been damaged by this unfortunate event.

I really do believe that every relationship we have gets us closer to the one that we are meant for because we learn a lot about ourselves and others from those experiences. I don’t think they are failures but rather just issues of compatibility and I believe you’re one step closer to finding the right match when you’re ready. 

Hope you feel better soon. Make sure reach out to your friends and family for support also. ☺️☀️

EDIT: P.S. Your skin is perfect.
Positive Vibes 💛
There's so many compliments I could give you for how good you look but my brain just wants me to talk about how lovely your handwriting is LMAO
 Oh how can someone leave that beautiful smile . Stay strong girl (well you're already strong cause you can smile at least ).If it ended by a 3 minutes phone call then you shouldn't waste much time and move on .
You are precious and beautiful. Your hair looks amazing btw. くコ:彡Squiddy loves you
Man, I wish I had your haircut! It's a style that doesn't look good on everybody, but to you... It really feels natural! Plus, checking on your profile, it looks like you're struggling with the fact that you feel a bit feminine (you don't, btw), but I guess it'll go away. I mean, you just had your surgery, it'll take time to feel right externally as you do internally. Who cares about other boys? Facial beauty is just a small part of the concept of beauty in this society, I assure you there are a lot of other aspects that matter. And to be honest, I'm a guy and I've got no shame telling you you're gorgeous! Anyway, one of the things I envy about transgender people (as once Ricky Gervais said) is that they understand what's so wrong about them and they get to fix it, by changing their gender! How amazing must you feel! And if not, you should, because you've been very brave to make such an important step in such a young age, and you somehow managed to look stunning! Be proud! I don't know what you're into, but believe me if I say that soon someone is gonna notice how beautiful you look inside and outside. You need more friends? Bro, I'm here! I know it's not much, but that's all I can do, so if you wanna chat, my PM's are open! I know that soon you'll find other friends in the real life as well, but for now, I'm here, bro!
YOURE CUTE
Honestly you look way cuter than most boys
you look great! as a hairdresser I would ask about getting a fauxhawk cut, all that glorious hair would make it gorgeous
Your hair looks so good though? It looks like it's so nice and fluffy, makes me wanna touch it, lmao, :P
The first picture though... your eyes look so determined! I bet you can do anything you set your mind to, believe in yourself!
Man you're way better looking than I am! In fact I'd say you're more attractive than most of the guys I know!
Hey man dont wanna chat but if you believe in yourself and you are friendly and welcoming all the good will happen to you. If you would towards me on a festival for sure i had a talk with you. You are not offputting in any way.
You’ve got really nice hair! I personally think the cut looks pretty good. It might take some time, but hopefully you find one you’re comfortable with. I’m actually jealous, I’m losing my hair at 25. Best of luck to you ❤️😁
Wait a second bro. You're actually hella attractive. And the haircut looks dope on you. Not a lot of people can pull it off.
I think you’re cute af! I love your eyes and lips. And I think your hair looks nice, like I would constantly run my hands through it and be messing it up.
I think your haircut looks great and you’re really handsome :0 I’m also a trans guy (19) & if you need someone to talk to about anything or just a friend, feel free to PM me :)
You're hot and the haircut is def making a Weeknd vibe rn. I love it, but if you hate it (give it a few days) someone suggested afauxhawk type deal that would be hot af too!
You look great! Try not to spend too long worrying about what other people look like because I promise everyone else is worrying about how they look too at times :)
What?! Cause I think you are totally pulling off that cut and is that a fade? Rock it with confidence!
I dunno man, i see your hair and it just looks like a regular guy haircut to me. Nothing wrong with it. Good thing about being male is that the only important thing your hair has to do is exist.
That haircut really suits you! You have a really handsome face, you don’t need to compare yourself to others, you already look fantastic.
You're fine, Handsome. Life has its ups and downs. Part of enjoying the rollercoaster ride of life is being able to eventually being able to expect the downs. I'm sorry it's been hard for you lately (and probably for a long time before now) but you got control of this. Whether you realize it or not, your eyes do not deceive you: you are handsome and you're smart because you've always been smart. 
It's time do make sure your rollercoaster is going up; get up for the day, do one thing productive (no matter how small), then get something to eat, then go do one thing for yourself. Get a new accessory, a new book (or check one out at a library), or hang out with/ try to make a new friend. Everything you don't already have is outside your front door. You need to be on the other side of it (hopefully dressed and with a full stomach and plenty of water on a day like today). You deserve better. Here's to you being strong! And here's to you being able to surprise yourself by realizing your true potential! Cheers!
You look like the coolest indie rocker since The Strokes were a thing. You're like all of The Strokes in one person. You're cool in my book.
your jawline is sharp af
You are seriously gorgeous
Are you sure you were ever a girl? I mean seriously...
You are being too hard on yourself. I think you look great. A young and handsome boy indeed.
thank you !
thank you man. 

and lol, i havent had surgery yet, im getting surgery in a few months hahah. but im on testosterone (hormone replacement) since 1 year and a half now. haha.

but anyway thank you, its hard to feel pride when i still dont feel like i have changed enough. 

and alright, ill message you if i ever feel the need to :)
i wish that were true, but seriously, thank you
i have naturally very curly hair, so its hard to style my hair a certain way. the way it was cut specifically makes it so that when my curls naturally curls, it looks super weird. i originally wanted a curlyhawk, but got to nervous to ask for one haha.. so i let him do whatever, ... a mistake lol
sorry about your hair loss :( some people say bald men are more attractive anyway..

but thank you
thank you. hahaha, there have been some people who want to play with my hair, but not too many. lol
okie, thanks for letting me know. ill pm you when i feel the need to, when i get lonely or bored enough hahaha
haha, thank you
thank you :)
My pleasure. ^_^
I really think you’re cute
you can totally pull off a fauxhawk then. I just did one this week on a curly haired kid. super friggin cute. I would have taken a pic but as an apprentice I can't advertise my services yet. my instagram has suffered for that. 
I would rec seeing a curl specialist though. someone who has devacurl training or something similar, only because curly hair is tricky and needs a lot more care.
for ex: I dry cut most curly hair and cut WITH the curl, and if it's thick I do chicken pickin. don't ask, its a Redken thing LOL
Edit: I can english I swear
yeah, i just dont know where to find people who know how to handle my hair. some can, some cant. its a bit frustrating not knowing whither or not im going to be getting a good or a bad cut, due to their inexperience with my hair type
its all in the consult. if you dont get a good consultation where you are on the same wavelength gtfo. I would offer to do it but im in canada aha
lol, im in canada as well. and yeah i get it, i gotta be more careful. but i usually have the "its just hair" mindset lol
oh nice! im in shitario. planning on being out west or montreal in a couple years
Smile, beard and hair is a solid 10/10.
You look like a chill guy to be around, your general demeanor in this picture is very welcoming. Your eyes, smile, posture- you look fun and accepting.

Im sorry that life is tough for you at the moment but I know you'll find the inner strength to be able to climb out of the terrible hole you're in.

&#x200B;

EDIT- You look like Mac from 'Its always Sunny in Philadelphia' & thats good because you're a total cutie
You’re adorable! Your smile could make my day. It feels like summer.
Your smile looks genuine to me! Thank you for smiling even if you don't feel like it.
You should smile moe because you be looking smooth my friend. Dig the shirt. Hope you find what ever you are looking for.
10 points. Dude I love the shirt.
You would never see that that smile is forced, such a beautiful and kind face. I hope you find the light again
You’re smile is so stunning! It made me smile. Your eyes frame your smile so beautifully
You are a good person and a lovely bean. Squiddy loves you. くコ:彡
You've got a very approachable face, one that people can be comfortable with. Try not to lose the teeth and you will do just fine :D
cute smile
You’re a really good looking guy and I love the shirt!
I’m glad you smiled even if you had to force it, because you have an amazing smile, and i feel a bit happier because of it. I hope that is you persevere you will finally get what you’re looking for and find happiness.
I know what it feels like to force a smile... I'm sorry you are struggling right now. But you know what, it's not always like this. It's not always this hard. And right now be kind to yourself, it's ok that it's hard and it's ok that you're struggling. Everyone struggles. But if you remember that people love you, even total strangers who will write a comment like this, you can see that it gets better. You're an amazing, valuable human and I'm glad that you're alive and you're you.
I'm digging the vibe you're putting off, my dude. I'd be your friend irl. Hang in there for the good days, there will be some soon. Take care of yourself.
Your forced smile warms my heart, and anyone who can work a pineapple shirt is a guy who deserves the sweetness that life has to offer—and all the things he wants for himself. You are not worthless, nor useless. You are a kind-hearted soul who makes the world better. Take good care.
You have a beautiful smile and I absolutely LOVE your shirt !
Yea i know that feel sometimes. But staying happy  is one of the hardest things in life and you surely would make me happy if you honesty smiled cause of me.
Even though you had to force it you have a lovely smile and very kind eyes. I’m sorry you’re dealing with so much, but I’m proud of you for reaching out to a group like this for help. I love the shirt and you’ve got really nice hair too! I hope things start to turn around, much love to you
Dang man, I love your shirt
I’m sorry you’re struggling, I’ve been there and it’s taken a lot of work to find things that help me, so I hope you can too. You have really kind eyes and even if it was forced you’re smile is so warm and friendly.
You look like the most honestly fun person at a wedding. You're cool by my account.
Aw, you have a great smile, you should do it more, it actually can trick the mind into being happy. You also have very kind looking eyes, and amazing pineapple shirt! You are far from worthless, each person can contribute to the world around them, even the smallest of things can make someone elses life better. I know you can make a big impact on the world around you, and be good to yourself! Try doing things that'll make you happy, be great to yourself, the world needs amazing people like you in it, and to be happy! Have a great day. :)
Even your forced smile is lovely, can only imagine how your genuine smile is! I know it's hard, trust me, but I truly hope you brighten the world again with your proper smile
Hey friend! I also struggle from depression so I know exactly how that feels.... the last few months for me have been that rollercoaster as well. Just please remember how loved and wanted you are. I know it’s so hard to believe that in the periods when we feel the most worthless and useless but i promise there are people out here who love and appreciate you as a person and want you in their lives. I really hope you feel better and like yourself again soon, if you ever need anyone to talk to or vent to please let me know! Otherwise just have a fantastic week! 

Ps: your smile is so so cute even if it is forced haha. I love your taste in shirts too!
You've got a kind face. I hope things get better for you soon
You look like a funny guy in a comedy.
You definitely have the face for smiling, my dude, so here's to hoping you get plenty of reasons to smile from here on out!!
You’ve got such a kind face :) (and it let’s be real you’re FIT)
And the shirt is awesome!
Thank you both!
Haha thanks! Mac is my favorite character

Yes indeed! So keep smiling dear sir!😊
Hope you’re doing ok <3
I’m trying my hardest
When you find out what you want to do and what you're good at, all of this will go away ... and that WILL happen. I had to go through a few jobs where I felt the same as you all the time, constant anxiety, always thinking I wasn't good enough ... imposter syndrome, essentially. But there *is* something out there you will rock at and that you'll love, and you *will* find it if you just keep at it and keep following your desires.

I believe in you.
49 here. Don't know what I want to do. It's gonna be ok. You are pretty and wanted.  Think happy thoughts. We need you!
Anyone could get lost in your eyes
I love your eyes. Hugs, you will find the thing you love and someone to share it with later
Wow. I could stare at those eyes till infinity and beyond :)
Is smol. And veri adorabul!
Take care pls, you are young, take ur time, dont put yourself down. Always be positive. U r a wonderful girl, full of energy, happiness and moreover you are pretty
I would kill for your eyes. They are stunning
Enjoy this day, we dont even are sure if we have tomorrow. Enjoy it, do what you love and everything else will fall in its place. Suddenly you will know what you want to do, and if not, it doesnt matter cause in the end the most important thing are family and friends and the time we spend with them. Hope you feel better now.
You’re way too young to know “what I want to do”. You’ll figure it out eventually 

Take it easy. It’s not a sprint.
It all starts with a dream. Life experience comes from mistakes. Without knowing failure, you will never know success. Love yourself. Ummm... I ran out of feel good stuff to say, this isn't my forté lol

I just retired from the military after 26 years of service and I still don't know what I want to be when I grow up. So in the meantime, I doing what I know and enjoy.
Who knows what the furture holds just work on the now and it will help you in the long run. Life is a mystery and i hope you solve yours.  Your eyes look warm and gooey like a chocolate dessert. Stay cool and think more about the positive aspects of your life .
You aren't alone in not knowing what you want to do with your future. However, you'll find something you love, even if you have to try a few different things to get there. For now, you can work on trying to love yourself. You're beautiful, and capable of great things! Also, great eyes, holy shit.
This happens to everyone-- you are not alone!

&#x200B;

Right now, focus on the things you can control, and remember that happiness is not a destination. It's not joy or excitement either. It's contentment, peace and gratitude.  These things take TIME! 

&#x200B;

You can do this! <3
Hey you look just past my surface into my soul and its great any guy could fall for that anytime. Also having a conversation with you would probably make me feel very special. (not interested in chat just what i would feel if we would meet(not interested in meeting i have a gf))
You are super gorg! Every part of you is gorgeous! You have amazing eyes, first off. Amazing is an adjective that keeps coming to mind. Your hair, skin, lips, nose, eyebrows, and everything else can all be fairly described as amazing. You have a very very nice figure and I can’t imagine not immediately noticing you in any room you walk into. You’re the kind of person who turns heads. If you look for it you’ll see it. I guarantee you will. You really do have plenty of reason to be confident. People notice you. I can tell you that for sure. It’s not because you’re awkward or you seem odd or anything like that though. It’s because you’re very very pretty. That’s not a bad position to be in. It’s a pretty good start, in fact.
You have hair that people would envy and you have pretty big blue or grey eyes.
Sometimes, our brain is not our friend. You were born good enough. Live up to your heart’s expectations. It has great things in store for you. Look in the mirror, acknowledge you are a beautiful woman who will not be defeated by the nonsense that is your brain’s bad day. It takes practice. Take good care. Xo
You're stronger than you think. The depth behind your eyes that is filled with negative thoughts will not disappear if you throw the thoughts out, it will remain but filled with something warmer and wiser.
It most have taken a lot of courage to post something and I’m proud and happy you did. Although you might have negative thoughts and idea but know there are people who say otherwise. I would love to hear what’s going on with your thoughts and your ideas of your future and hear you out
I hope you can get rid of Anxiety toast and turn it in to a super one to the point where you can be calm, and happy
33 here. I´ve figured out what i want to do in small pieces. First it was music(more than 15 years ago), still is and it brings balance to my life. About 6 years ago i went through few therapy sessions and there i was asked if i´ve made 5 year plan or similiar, i hadn´t. For the next session i was prepared. It took few days to figure out what i want to do for living, what i want to do with my freetime, where do i live etc. 

&#x200B;

Without putting any conscious work to it, 6 years later i´m now there. i only took the first step by getting a degree from school and things kind of escalated. 

&#x200B;

What i´m trying to tell you with my "history lesson" here is that when you figure out what you want to do and who you want to do it with and where you want to do it, you´ll get there at some point. I´m 100% sure of it. There´s no fire without a spark :)
Your 18, have a good relationship, an adorable puppy.  At your age i would say life is good.  If you plan on university get going under general studies for a year or so and maybe touch on a class or 2 per semester that is a field your curious about.  What kind of work you do now?  Love travel go marketing or management, and when you turn 21 apply to be a flight attendant.  Like to get your hands dirty aircraft maintenance engineer, even pilot.  Empathetic when loved ones are sick maybe nursing or healthcare.  At your age you are limited by only what your dreams and imagination.  Let them guide you and you can accomplish anything.
Thank you ♥️
RIGHT THOUGH!??!?
V smol ♥️
Thank you! I’m trying, it’s just hard
Goon on you! I am proud. My anxieties make it hard, I am trying it’s just hard.
I feel like I stay in my comfort zone too much out of fear. I’m trying to venture out it’s just very difficult! Thanks ♥️
Too much time! Thank you though ♥️
Green :p
I’m trying. It’s just hard to push away all the negativity. Thank you ♥️
Feel free to dm me 😊
I wish help u, I wish be there
I completely understand. My ex-wife had such a problem with her anxiety that she rarely left the house. It was hard for her to make friends. She went to school to be a veterinary assistant, and only managed to work for a couple weeks because of her anxiety. She didn't drive, so while I was deployed was extremely difficult for her. 

I have a feeling though, that you'll get this figured out. I believe in you!
I’m in such a similar situation to her?! Like I don’t drive, I wanted to be a vet, I can’t make friends! Am I your wife?
Idk... You could be! lol
YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL I JUST WANNA FEED YOU PUMPKIN PIE
I like the glasses and your hair. You have a nice smile. And you’re brave to ask for some support when you need it.
Hey that days probably ended and the next day will be better.
A good rest often helps me on a bad day. Try that with other self care. Also, if those trophies in the back are yours that’s impressive!
Bad days are the worst.  Your hair is gorgeous, you look like you are epic at trivia nights with those glasses and would totally thrash the competition!
I hope your bad day gets better! Your eyes are so stunning, they’ve got a kind soft look to them
I'm sorry your day was rough. The fact that you wrote it down and asked for support means you'll never be down for long! Try again tomorrow <3
You'll get through this. I know you will.
You have a lovely smile and your glasses suit you so well. I wish I looked that good when I was 12! Tomorrow’s a new day:)
You ma'am are a beautiful, gentle and kindhearted woman who makes other people smile and feel loved.  You must also be exceptionally talented as evidenced by those two big trophies behind you.
I wish I had that wavy type of hair like you have. It’s something I’ve always wanted naturally. It’s hard to achieve being biracial, with more ethnic hair than not.
Thank you!! I don't really eat pie but I will certainly accept it!!!! 💞💓
Thank you!! I've always been nervous about my looks so that really helps!!! 💙
Thank you! You're right about that💟
Thank you!! I've been struggling with sleep lately, so I'll definitely work on it. And yeah, those are my trophies. I don't take karate anymore, but they're from tournaments. Thanks!!! ❤
Thank you!!! I do know a lot of useless little facts from being online so much, so maybe I would do well! 🖤
Thank you! I've always been a little worried about my appearance being that I'm in that teenage awkward phase, so that really helps! 💜
Thank you!!! I'll keep working and soon I'm sure it'll all be better. 💕
Thank u for the support!! 💛
Thank you!!! I've always been a little insecure about how I look, so that really helps!!! 💚
Thank you so much!!! I always try my best to lift others when they are down. 💓
Thank you!! I'm sure with a little bit of work you can get your hair like mine. I'm not very good with my hair (I struggle literally washing it) so it's a miracle that it's like this. Keep trying!! 💝
Karate is a great hobby you should go into training again!
We need more people like you.
💞💞💞
